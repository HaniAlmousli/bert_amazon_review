I'm still not sure what the difference is between Site Advisor and Site Advisor Plus.  From what I have read Plus also warns about bad links in emails and IMs.  If thats the only difference, its not worth paying for the Plus version.  After I finished installing the software I was given the option to "learn more" or something, I don't remember exactly what it said.  I assumed it would tell me about some of the features of the software I just installed.  Instead I was taken to the product catalog on the McAfee web site.  I suppose I could have looked for the product listing, but the way it was presented to me, like they want me to buy more software, was a turn off and I just closed the web page.

The stupid Site Advisor toolbar is back on Internet Explorer, this really bugs me because I can turn it off, but it always comes back.  I never use the button, and I have a 12" laptop, so I don't need this thing taking up screen space.

Site Advisor Plus seems to do what it's supposed to, but I don't see the benefit in paying for the Plus version.
