Norton 360 packages its two top products in one package - Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security into one package with a few extras!

The reason that I mention this first is because if your antivirus is about to expire, do not renew it if you are going to buy this, you will be doubling up and paying for something you do not need! Just buy this and you antivirus subscription will be included.

No for the bad news.  Each generation of Norton is getting more and more invasive.  What I mean by this is Norton seems to want to take over my computer!  First it is telling me what is using most of the memory but not what to do.  So, I guess if it did not moniter memory, there would be more memory for other programs!  Also, it keeps telling me to convert my seach engine to Norton because it is will only allow approved sites.  But I buy the antivirus to protect me when I go to more questionable sites.  Not to keep me from them. (I have gotten warnings of questionability of site on some major sites like British Airways. If there is a problem, I don't want to be kept from them but protected if there is something wrong.)

Basically, what I am saying is just do your job and nothing more.  Give the option once and then let me decide.
