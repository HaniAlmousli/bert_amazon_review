I am a 1 person business so this isn't ideal for me, if you are mid sized, this maybe great for you. There's a ton of features that I just don't need. Also the renewal factor is off putting. I did recommend this to my friend who las a larger business. You can get the 3 user on the sage website for 550, it's 849 on Amazon
