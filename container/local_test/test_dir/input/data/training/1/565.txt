I purchased this product a couple of days ago and lucky me I did not open the box yet. Browsing Symantec website I realized that they added product activation to their 2004 software like Norton Antivirus, System Works, and Internet Security. I'm a legitimate System Works and Internet Security user. Every year in September I upgrade to the new version. This would have been the fourth upgrade since I already own Norton Internet Security and System Works for 2001, 2002, and 2003. This new activation scheme is outrageous!!! I did not use any pirated software and I don't intend to start now but I change my hardware a lot and reinstall applications and I find that by requiring product activation Symantec hits me as a legitimate user since the product allows only 5 activations. In 4 months I will be unable to use it if I reinstall the OS 5 times, and here I am, a legitimate user and a loyal customer who paid Symantec for 4 years unable to use software I paid for. I find it outrageous and unacceptable. This is not what I deserve as a loyal customer ! There must be better ways to stop piracy.
That said, this Norton Internet Security 2004 goes back to the store and this is the last time I buy Symantec Products. I will use my older software for a time and then find some other application suite from some other software vendor, that does not reduce me a legitimate customer to the level of a software thief. Stay away from these activation schemes if you want to be able to control what you own ! They do not protect us, they protect ONLY their revenue. I'm very disappointed in Symantec and they can bet I'm no longer a Symantec user and customer. Like the guy before me said: Avoid like the plague! We have to stand for our rights as legitimate users and the only thing I can do is to stop using these programs. They invested money in developing activation schemes instead of making the program better !!!!! Shame !
