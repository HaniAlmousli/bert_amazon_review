I've been using Dreamweaver (and it's predecessor Macromedia's UltraDev) for many years.  For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.

On the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don't expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.

It's important to note that there's a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn't covered here...it's possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :)

As I said above, if you're a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.
