Like others have mentioned, when you buy this almost $200 program, you do not get a full package - it is merely a instrument for them to charge you subscription fees.  It reminds me of some shareware programs that disable features until you buy the full version, but in this case you have already bought the full version and they still want to get more money from you!  I'm sort of the "go to" guy in my circle of friends and family when it comes to technical and/or business software and even though I would never spend a penny on this, noticed a friend had purchased this so I decided to see for myself and it only reiterated how disgusting Intuit's business practices are.  Here are a few reasons why you should avoid this program:

Payroll.  The ability to write paychecks and pay income withholdings is one of the most basic accounting tools one would expect from a "pro" accounting package but it is missing from this program.  Even if you do it yourself, you have to pay an extra $200 each year to have the privilege downloading tax forms and you can only shell out the extra $200 for 3 years because after spending $600 in the end of the 3 years, you'll have to buy the newest version of Quickbooks.

Again, this is for DO IT YOURSELF!  You'll print the checks on your own paper, your own computer and all they'll do is give you the tax tables.  They can easily integrate the tax tables in the software but their excuse is that it may not be up to date.  That is a complete cop-out because all they would have to do to fix that is to let you adjust the table if rates go up or down;  besides, they require you to replace the program every 3 years anyway.

They used to offer one free tax table download in the older versions but they wanted more money and they got rid of that. There IS a hidden "manual payroll" option, but even if you can find it past all the ads for subscriptions, they get you if you want to print the forms for the IRS.  Yes, in order to use the same IRS forms that you can download for free from the IRS, you have to pay intuit for their integrated version.

file attachments
As others have mentioned, you have to pay to save attachments to invoices in your own computer!

bloatware
What was one a simple program now install a ton of nagware that you don't want with no option to shut it off.

no easy way to export
They know they got you so they don't have any tools to convert their files to other format.

I give up.  Intuit using their "customer retention managers" to pressure amazon to delete negative reviews and comments aside, since the changing of the new social security tax rate (employee end), I can no longer print my tax forms and at the begging of my CPA, I was convinced that I have to get the new version AND since the new version doesn't let you print tax forms without subscribing to ENHANCED PAYROLL AND PAYING EXTRA FOR THE UNLIMITED EMPLOYEES, this $200 program will cost me around $500 for the first year and around $300 each following year until they force me to upgrade again.

This is a MONOPOLY.  So enjoy my money for now Intuit, you have won this round. The time will come when the DOJ hits you with an anti-trust lawsuit, FTA will come down on you for making fake positive reviews, or an enterprising software company beats you at your own game.

******UPDATE 2*****
This is seriously as bad as everybody says.  Nagware everywhere.  I can't even click on a link before getting "interviewed" to see what spam they can sell me.  I've tried removing them but it's nowhere to be found in the options.

I subscribed to enhanced payroll and had to stay on tech support in India for an hour to figure out why the $300 I had just shelled out wasn't working.

Where are you DOJ???
