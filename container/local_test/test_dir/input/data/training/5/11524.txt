My previous subscription to Norton antivirus was expiring and got the typical daily warnings from them each day for a month.  Since it was far more economical to buy a new version than renew, that is what I did.  All I needed to do was use the new license number provided in the new purchase and I now had another years worth of coverage.  There was really no new download, just continuing the current version with new daily virus updates.  If you choose this method Norton will continue sending renewal messages for quite a while, it appears they don't know you replaced the old version with the new one.
