I have tried on multiple occasions to install this software. It downloads just fine, and installs (I tried all ways, none of which are consistent with the instructions on the software card), but I am never able to set up a Kaspersky account, which is apparently needed to set up this software.. I follow all instructions and it will never proceed beyond my entering and verifying my account password. I have given up on this and can only give it the lowest rating. It may work well for you, but I could just not get it installed...
