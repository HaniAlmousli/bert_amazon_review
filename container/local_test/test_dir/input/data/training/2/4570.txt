I bought the expensive TurboTax Business to do the taxes for two trusts held at our broker.  Quess what?  This expensive version can not download those transactions into the program.  WHY!!!!  I would expect most trusts have investments held at a broker, but TurboTax doesd not see fit to give you an easy way to get those transactions into the tax return.

The reasonably priced Deluxe version works just fine at downloading those same transactions into my personal tax return.  So I had to manually enter each one of the stock transactions.
