Well, this was the easiest Norton product I have ever installed.  In less than 10 minutes, I was up and running on the devices I wanted it on.  I cant say how reliable this is since I haven't had a need to test it out yet, however, if it works as stated, I will be real happy if I need to use it.  The biggest problem I have with all of these types of products is that they don't let you do a lifetime subscription for all of your items at once.
