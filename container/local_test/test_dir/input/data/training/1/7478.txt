Horrible, absolutely horrible.  About one time out of 25 tries, this program will load and I can use it.  Other than that, it just does nothing when I try to open it, or it takes 30 minutes to load about 950 songs that I have in it.  This is on Windows 10.  I have quit purchasing music from Amazon because of this.
