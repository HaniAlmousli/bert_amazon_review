I am a loyal Norton user.  I've used Norton SystemWorks (NSW) for many years, and have been consistently happy.  I'm running Vista Ultimate on a great computer (Pentium D Processor 940 at 3.2 Ghz, 4 GB RAM).  I downloaded NSW from Symantec's web site, but it won't install.  After expasperting sessions with "English as a second language" tech support, I was finally able to install the software.  After running several of the "check/fix routines" on NSW, many other programs did not work.  I had to reinstall at least five different programs.  I'm back to normal, thanks to back-ups I made on an external hard drive before installing NSW.  But, I am afraid to run the "check/fix routines" on NSW again until (or if) they fix the glitches.
