Incredibly versatile, MapPoint 2010 is packed with mapping functionality and the options are plentiful.

Once you begin to explore MapPoint's features, you will quickly realize its potential benefits for either recreational travel or business. It is a powerful piece of software.

The pushpins have been updated to include many more symbols to choose from.

The "Measure Distance" tool allows you to trace along routes with instant feedback so you may find out if it really is "shorter to go that way."

Planned routes can be searched for places or points of interests along the way within specified distances, and MapPoint will display an easy-to-follow proximity-highlighted readout of the results complete with extended information. You can easily expand or contract the distance criterea as well.

Under the Map Settings tab, you can selectively add or remove symbols, labels or both from various types of featured map points making custom views extremely simple.

There are so many possibilites with MapPoint 2010, and it is a much more powerful program than Streets and Trips. Powerful Data Mapping features allow you to do business-related analysis visually. If you are interested only in finding your way around, it would be more cost-efficient to go the Streets and Trips route...otherwise this is a remarkable package - I love MapPoint 2010!
