My Dell 1905FP is an excellent LCD monitor.  The default ICM profile made it appear a bit too bright and/or harsh but the color was fine.  After calibrating it with this it looks MUCH better.  Colors appear natural and in the correct balance.  I now make prints that are very close to matching what I see on the monitor whereas before it was pretty much a trial and error process.  Highly recommended for digital photographers.
