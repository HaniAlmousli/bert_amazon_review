I've used Office for years on PCs, but this was my first time to use  Office 2008 for Mac. I have an Intel-based iMac and this software product is slow. Compared with Apple's iWork suite of office-like programs, Office is simply snail-like. Although Office 2008 has a few more features than iWork it's not as tightly integrated among applications. Office still has the look and feel of a loose collection of programs acquired over the years by Microsoft and  called a "system." I much prefer the cheaper and more tightly integrated iWork over Office 2008 and wish I had saved my money and bought only iWork.
