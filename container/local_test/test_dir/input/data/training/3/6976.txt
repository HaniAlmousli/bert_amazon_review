I'm not a professional video person, just a father who likes getting those precious, once-in-a-lifetime moments on video of the kids that you just don't ever want to miss.

I originally picked up this Power Director 11 Ultra, but although I'm a rookie in video, I do have much higher expectations in my product, so I picked up the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Power-Director-11-Ultimate-Suite/dp/B009716H00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Power Director 11 Ultimate Suite</a>&nbsp;too, and I'm glad I did. So you're better off just skipping the Ultra and just getting the Ultimate Suite instead, you'll be glad you did too.

The Power Director 11 Ultimate Suite is a wonderful video editing program. The suite consists of the Power Director 11 Ultra, but adds ColorDirector & SoundDirector for further video and sound enhancement.

Although the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Power-Director-11-Ultimate-Suite/dp/B009716H00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Power Director 11 Ultimate Suite</a>&nbsp;is large which is close to 2 GB, resource wise, it is ample and does not bog down your system, as the results of other resource hogging software. However, it does take a while when editing those large GB files.

It does require seperate registrations for all 3 programs (PowerDirector / ColorDirector / SoundDirector) even though it is one package. I don't know why the set it up that way, but... oh well!

The bonus is that you if you are a Utimate Suite user, you get the PowerDirector Mobile software for Windows 8 tablets for free. That is a nice feature in itself.

Overall, the Ultra is okay, but lacking. However, I'm very satified with the bundle of the Ultimate suite and I'm looking to get the most out of it, for both video and sound.
