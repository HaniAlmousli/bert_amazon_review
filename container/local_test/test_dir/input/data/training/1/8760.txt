I have tried for a week to get this key code started.  I used Webroot last year and found it fine for what I needed.  I tried to extend my Webroot android protection and have had nothing but failure.  The website will not let me update my old key code because it says that my old key code in invalid (yeah I know that) but, then it will not let me change the key code because the email address that I use is associated with the old key code.  Anyway, this has been a do loop created by Webroot that sends me to URLs "not found", logs me out of the verification page before I can put in the security code, and the help function also sent me off into ether land - an email that would get back to me - two days ago.  I have bought another package and I have learned a lesson about Webroot.  What a waste of time and money.
