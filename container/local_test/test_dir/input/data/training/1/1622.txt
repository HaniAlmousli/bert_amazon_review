Installs fine.

Uninstalls fine, after 3 hrs, due to phishing toolbar not working properly and chat room Norton Tech advising me to do so.

Does not reinstall, but gives off error popups.

Talk with Norton Techs on Chat line for 4 separate times, with no luck, besides frustration.

Norton Tech Chat Line is manned by uncourteous, non-mannered, non prepared and unknowledgeable people.  I was transfered 5 times from different tech's on 1 chat call and then hung up on.  Another tech kept asking if this was the first time I contacted the chat room, even after I said no and sent him my prior 3 chat authorization numbers for his verification. Poor Service on assistance.

I used the normal uninstall procedure and then the Norton Total Uninstall icon, both with negative results.  The registry is now splattered with Norton Reminants.

Software is now unable to be reinstalled (due to error popups), used only 3 hrs, the first night.

This Junk Software has not changed since the last time I swore I would not use it again (2004).

I hope their refund system works right!

P.S. This is a new Dell Computer I tried to install this software on.  I have no other Norton software installed or ever installed.
