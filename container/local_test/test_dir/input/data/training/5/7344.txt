I was anxious to get started so I chose the electronic download. After installation, I updated to the latest version. Three hours later, I had edited 4 hour long videos and burned each to DVD. Very smooth operation, yet many options are available that I haven't even gotten to try out. I'll be honest, the machine I'm using this software on was designed and built to take advantage of multi-threaded processing/rendering and it has preformed most efficiently. I believe my opinion of this software will grow even more positive with use and becoming more familiar with many of its undiscovered options.

Update: I began to read reviews on the newest version (X7) and decided to upgrade. The results are even better as this version
is built around the 64 bit architecture for those who have 64 bit machines. I was a bit confused because Corel indicated this will work with 32 bit or 64 bit machines yet the electronic download from their site clearly separates the two. My assumption would be that the retail package would contain both iterations. This X7 version definitely takes advantage of today's hardware because the processing, rendering and burning all increase substantially. Although I'm still a fan of version X6, kicking it up notch (X7) was worth the price.
