Vista should get no stars. We are all beta testers for Mad Doctor FrankenGates. I hope he burns inhell for all the trouble he has caused with this junk known as Vista. Microjunk is so worried about themselves and their profits, they have forgotten how to take care of their customers. Don't waste your money on any more micro-junk, buy a Mac like I did. You will not be disappointed.
Microsoft vista......What a joke!
