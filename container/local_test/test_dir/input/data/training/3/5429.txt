GUEST REVIEWER - ! MRS. KNOW IT ALL ;-b

This software upgrades the interface from previous versions---but in a good way, as it is a lot more intuitive.  Basically, allowing me to capture, convert and copy digital media is a BIG plus.  A nice feature for CD burning, is that it will automatically split up large numbers of songs over multiple CDs without the need for you figuring out how many songs you can actually burn on the disc.  So, you can just keep clicking away and it will figure it all out for you---and allow you to create multiple copies all at once.  I found the software to be slow at some times when burning large amounts, but it did get the job done.
