My gripe relates exclusively to the activation scheme, which includes surreptitious installation of a rogue program called C-Dilla on your hard drive.
I've been using TT for roughly ten years.  The program itself is great, but I'm strongly opposed to the aggravation of the various activation processes used by Intuit, Microsoft and others.  I concur with the need for software developers to protect themselves against piracy, but it shouldn't be done at the expense of honest consumers.  So, next year I switch to TaxCut.
