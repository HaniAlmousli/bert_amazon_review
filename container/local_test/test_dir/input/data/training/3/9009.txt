This is a one-year subscription to Office 365, which can be installed on one PC/MAC and one tablet/phone.

This includes all the standard office products: Word, Excel, OneNote, Access, PowerPoint, Publisher, and Outlook.

The only office product available for Android is OneNote. This used to be one of my favorite office products, but it's been really crippled by the move to integrate it across platforms. It's not nearly as flexible as it used to be. In the desktop version you can still create section groups, but they won't sync with the mobile version. You also can't add more space to pages the way you used to.

The other office products work as well as ever. I wish at least Word was available for Android, though. I guess Microsoft wants to push people toward their mobile OS, though.

I'm not a huge fan of subscription software in general. When I buy something, I want it to be mine. I didn't like having to setup a Microsoft account to use the software. I've been using OpenOffice for a long time and I don't anticipate fully switching to the Microsoft products. For one thing, the subscription runs out in a year. Also, I feel OpenOffice protects my privacy a lot better.

If you have to have office, then you have to have office. It Access and PowerPoint are definitely worth the price of the software, also.
