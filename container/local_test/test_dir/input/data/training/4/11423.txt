I use Dragon Naturally Speaking on my Window desktop so I decided to give the new version of Dictate a try. It installs and runs in the background like a service.  Make sure you update to  Dragon 5 for Mac version 5.0.4 released in December.  In Word is does a decent job of dictation which is my primary use but it still produces extra spaces and seems to forget the mic now and then.
