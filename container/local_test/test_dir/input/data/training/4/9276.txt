I have the 2012 version installed on a netbook running Windows XP that I carry with me when I travel.  I found 2012 a complete rethinking of the much older version that I had been using for a number of years. Now the 2014 is an update rather than an upgrade. If you have another version of Family Tree Maker on your computer installing this one means you have two versions on your computer.

I uninstalled 2014 from the netbook and installed it on a new laptop with Windows 8.1.  It went on easily with the program immediately updating itself and also downloading and installing at least twice in the last month.  You do need to install the program entirely to your computer. You cannot run it by putting the disc in the CD/DVD drive. Do make sure you have a substantial amount of memory available on your hard drive.

I can't tell a great deal of difference between the 2012 version and this version. However, there was a paper manual included, which is a miracle.  It's a handy size and easy to read and follow if you have some basic knowledge of the program.

The public record searches seem better. I'm not sure if this is due to Ancestry.com or the program, but I discovered a number of pieces of information that I had been missing.

OK, if you have an old computer with not much space on the hard drive I cannot recommend this.  I'm not fond of Windows 8.1 but this program works better with it than with XP.  If you have a recent copy of this program, At least 2012, I don't think it is necessary to update. But if you want the latest and greatest with most of the bells and whistles I would go with this one.

I'm only an amateur, but one of the things that drives me crazy is that many other amateurs don't source properly.  Follow the instructions in the manual and you should be in good shape as far as sourcing.
