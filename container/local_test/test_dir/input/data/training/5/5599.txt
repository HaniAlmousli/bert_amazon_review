I have used just about every product on the market from obscure to wildly popular. We've had the least problems with ANYTHING since converting to Kaspersky and we keep going back to it.

The biggest difference we noticed is less "stuff" running in the background and slowing down the computer.

Installing is about the same as any software. It just takes a little time and you follow the prompts.

Love Kaspersky and recommend them to everyone.
