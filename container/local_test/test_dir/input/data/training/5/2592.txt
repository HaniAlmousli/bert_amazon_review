It covers screen barely on sides. Falls bit short on top n bottom too. It may look like large size guy wearing medium size pants. Display is amazingly sharp, stunning and beautiful. It catches No fingerprints. It doesn't create a glare either. Works perfectly in outdoor too. Giving 5 stars only due to size issue. I wish it would be bit larger on all edges. I haven't dropped my phone since applying this screen protector so can't speak for that part. Will see how it goes.
