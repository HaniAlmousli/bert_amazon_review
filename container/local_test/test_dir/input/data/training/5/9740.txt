This is easy to install, works well and has a nice layout. I especially like the idea of the Wi-Fi Net Guard protection.

The layout of McAfee is nice. It is less cluttered than Norton.

The Navigation Center lays out the features in a simple an easy to understand way. The vulnerability scanner is a nice feature that helps a person see weak spots that make a computer vulnerable. If a person has children the parental controls are easy to use and work well. McAfee has a nice site that allows users to get information about threats.

I have used Norton for a number of years because I was not happy with McAfee. I am impressed with the changes made to McAfee. I now have McAfee on one computer and Norton on another. Hopefully the virus protection will be as good as the layout and ease of use.
