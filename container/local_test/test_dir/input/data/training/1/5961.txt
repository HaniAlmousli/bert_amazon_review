I tried N.I.S. on my late model notebook PC, and over a 1.5 year period, full system scans were never completed because it took too long!  Even with the newest 2012 version update. I always had to stop the scan because it would be 18 hours, or 21 hours in, and the scan would STILL be in process!  Just yesterday, after 21 hours of initiating a full system scan, I stopped the scan.  N.I.S. scanned about 1,410,000 files, and was STILL GOING!  Quick scans take about 10 minutes, so at least that seems to be working.  I made sure screen savers and sleep modes were in fact turned off for the full system scans, but it still took almost a full day after I ran out of patience! For the record, my PC is a Toshiba running Win 7, 4 gigs RAM, and an AMD Phenom triple core processor. Not exactly a slow machine. Without being able to complete a full system scan, within reasonable time, to give me 'peace of mind' that ALL files are checked and secure, I cannot recommend this product. In addition, my browser slows to a crawl, and at times even stops working completely, when N.I.S. is automatically downloading current updates! RIDICULOUS!
