I like the subtle improvements in usability and features.  There are some powerful changes;  BUT, the rotating beach ball (the equivalent of the Windows hourglass) is a MUCH more common occurrence.  There is more lag in applications, and accessing the disk drive is noticeably slower for me.  As much as I love Apple computers and the progression of enhancements in OS X, I value the speed of my laptop more; so this is one upgrade I could have done without.
