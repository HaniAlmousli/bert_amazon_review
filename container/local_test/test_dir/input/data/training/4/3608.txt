While I did not expect much with McAfee Internet Security 2009 it did, at least, meet my expectations.  As someone that works in the computing industry I know how the consumer level anti-virus packages can be below par and really cause headaches for the end user.  Corporate level packages are much better, but I will get off topic here...

McAfee Internet Security 2009 was decently quick during the installation and updating phases.  It followed the usual steps of uninstalling older software packages and did it with ease, but I'm sure it was just luck in my case.  After the install and updating, I found the menus to be fairly easy to navigate.  However, I personally feel that most anti-virus/internet security packages (McAfee included) offer too many options.  At the end of the day most people just want to know that their PC is protected.  McAfee does a decent job of offering a compromise between simple, straight-forward menus and more complicated options should the user want them.

After a couple weeks of use, Internet Security 2009 has been running smoothly.  I have not noticed too much of a slow down on my system and the software has not been too nagging with pop-ups and warnings.  As for firewalls, it does a good job out of the box without too much hassle and blocking.

Overall, its speed has been above par and resource usage has been relatively low.  Comparing Internet Security 2009 to previous versions, I would certainly recommend it as an upgrade.  Compared to its competition, it's really on par.  It does not offer anything substantial above its competitors, nor does it offer any negatives.  Your previous experience with this brand and the price of the product should be among your deciding factors.  I have used just about all of the consumer level security packages and I tend to stick with a single brand and McAfee is certainly a brand that you can trust.
