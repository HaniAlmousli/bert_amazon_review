You will be sorry.

I downloaded the Windows 8 upgrade Thursday evening into Friday morning.
Yes, the download took several hours on my 3Mbs DSL line. After the download, it took another 3 hours to install the Windows 8 Pro over my Vista Business OS.
After that was done, I was faced with a very foreign user interface. There was no help offered to ease the transition. I finally figured out that the Windows key on my keyboard would present me with a desktop. No Start button, just a bunch of new Apps.
The upgrade did not preserve any of my old apps, so I must reload Office, my scanning software, Adobe Reader and all my other apps.
The new Internet Explorer won't let me use my old email system. Apparently there are some default browser settings that won't let me open the newer att.net mail, so I am using the old version.
What's the deal with Windows mail? I tried registering, but it keeps telling me that I am already registered and must use some existing password that it apparently emails to my new Windows email account that I can't log into.

The resemblance to Widows XP, or Vista is lost to me. This new Wibdows 8 more closely resembles Android, except I find Android easier to use. Maybe because my tablet has a touch screen and a voice command interface. I'm told Windows 8 is designed for a touch screen interface, but my PC does not have that. Actually, now that I think of it, I had fewer troubles adapting to Linux and Unix when I first strarted using them.

I suppose I'll get used to it, but for now, I am using my older PC thst still has XP installed. Even though it is an older PC, I can get a lot more done, more quickly.
I'll turn on my newer PC when I have more time to figure things out. For now, I'll stick with XP.
