Microsoft Office for Mac is the worst software I've ever wasted my money on. I paid like $400 for it and it barely operates. It even crashes my $3000 macbook pro almost every time I use it. And good luck ever trying to compain to Microsoft. DO NOT BUY IT! If you really want it, "aquire" it by other means.
