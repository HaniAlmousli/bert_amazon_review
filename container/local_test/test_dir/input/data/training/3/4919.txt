Talk about mixed feelings.  I worked with photos with the program and was very pleased with the eventual results.  The program did not crash or anything but for some features when you started it working you could go get a drink and have an conversation before it eventually completed the task.  The effects were what I would expect and the results very pleasing... eventually.  It performed much better on my higher level computer that I use for programming than it did on the home computer.  Basically, I was well pleased with it on a Windows 7 computer with 4 GB ram and a quad core processor.  On the XP, it was terrible.

I did some minimal work with the video part of the program and it seemed to work well too.  I do not do much video work so while my opinion is that it worked well, I did not try anything advanced.  That is part of the irony of the program.  Great product and abilities for the home user/hobbyist/advanced amateur but requires the hardware of a professional system to work well.  So, who is their target audience?  Is it professionals or advanced amateurs?

Either way, I liked the product when I ran it on the higher level system, but might have given it a one on the average home system.  So, I settled for three.  If your system hardware is up to date then give it a try, if it is a couple years old then don't bother.
