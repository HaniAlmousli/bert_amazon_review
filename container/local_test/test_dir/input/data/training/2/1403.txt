I purchased Outlook 2007 because Microsoft has now chosen to exclude it from certain versions of Office 2007. Well, it has way less features than my previous Outlook:

 - no animated GIF's
 - no support for Outlook Personal Address Book (PAB)
 - the Outlook Text Editor has been eliminated

And now I find that if you purchase this `stand alone' version of Outlook 2007 the `Themes and Stationary' feature is disabled. It only works in those versions of Outlook 2007 that are bundled with the Office Suite, not this version!

This is NOT AN UPGRADE, it's a DOWNGRADE!
