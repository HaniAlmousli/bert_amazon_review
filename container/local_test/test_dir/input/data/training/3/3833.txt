I like the idea of having "vaults" for important files. Especially if you are sharing the computer with other people. The software installed without problem, but I have had some problems with the software ceasing to respond when I try to open or close a vault.  This happens about half the time I try to use it, and really makes using the vaults a pain.  The only other thing I don't like about it is that vaults are limited in size to 4GB.  If I wasn't having problems with the software I would give it 4 stars.
