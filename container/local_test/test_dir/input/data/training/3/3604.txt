Both McAfee and Norton have gotten a reputation for gobbling up system memory and slowing performance with their anti-virus engines.  Both of them have also rewritten the code behind their latest security suites.  In addition to much more efficient anti-virus engines, each of them has added more functionality and loosened up their offerings to provide the option to secure your entire household with one license if you choose to purchase the 3-user version.

There is also a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/1-User/dp/B001DSNIXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">1-User</a>&nbsp;version for those looking for limited systems, but they are so close in price that it usually makes more sense to get the 3-user version.  Keep in mind that once you install the 3-user version on one machine, the clock starts ticking.  So you have to use it for 3 users concurrently.  You cannot install it on the same machine for 3 years in a row.  Like most anti-virus products, the license includes virus definition updates for only one year.

Unfortunately, there are still some shortcomings that make these programs less ideal for power users.  As time goes on, more and more home users are starting to fall into that category.

Over the past year I have been testing a variety of security suites and anti-virus programs for a work-related project.  This includes multiple versions of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Norton/dp/B001E0RZ3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Norton</a>&nbsp;for both home and business environments, McAfee,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trend-Micro-Antivirus-Antispyware-2009/dp/B001CPJHGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trend Micro Antivirus + Antispyware 2009</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bitdefender-Internet-Security-2009/dp/B001C31OZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bitdefender Internet Security 2009</a>&nbsp;and others.  I also continue to use some of the freeware alternatives on a few of my personal machines, including AVG and Avast.  I do not want to outline or rank all the programs here.  I only want to provide a context for how I came to some of these conclusions regarding McAfee's relative strengths and weaknesses.  Some of the strengths make this a good program for hands-off home users, but more demanding users may want to look elsewhere.

The biggest improvement that McAfee has incorporated into their product is a much more efficient scanning engine that is more resource friendly than prior versions.  In terms of *online* scanning of files, this program runs faster than most alternatives.  It also uses less memory, at least for the anti-virus engine.

But in terms of system impact, there still appears to be a performance hit from using this product for certain situations.  Certain types of internet applications just seem slower.  It also adds a noticeable delay to the startup time.  I tested clean install images with updated service packs before and after installing this program.  I speculate that some of the other elements of the program, such as the anti-phishing and anti-spyware, may be using other processes in memory and slowing down performance only for applications that trigger them.

Ironically, it seems like those components do not work as well as the included alternatives in competing programs.  Testing these out in a lab environment, the McAfee program was one of the slowest to detect spyware and phishing risks for known vulnerabilities.  There are some additional features that can compensate for that on the enterprise version of the product, but on this one you just have to accept that it is slightly slower at detecting those things.

The "Total Protection" version of the product also includes a network aware component that may appeal to SMB customers.  That program is supposed to detect rogue network devices and similar risks, but I have seen poor to mixed results with it.  I suspect there is overhead in this program for those features included in Total Protection version of the product that haven't been activated here.  I can't be 100% sure, but considering how much faster the anti-virus engine runs it is one possible reason why there is still a slowdown of system performance for certain situations.

One other thing that I noticed was that the newest version of Norton Internet Security has a much more detailed application firewall.  For those that use many complex internet applications that require custom settings, that program offers more granular control for those willing to dig down into the settings.  The basics are all covered here, but it is not as easily reconfigured.  On the same token, the default setting of the program requires constant confirmation for the system to adjust security settings for your applications.  It is possible to limit these warnings, but the configuration is not set ideally out of the box.

CONCLUSION

The strengths of the program are the improved easy to use interface and faster anti-virus scanning.  This 2009 version will definitely use less system memory than prior versions, at least directly.  It seems easy to punish McAfee and Norton for their past sins, but both products have improved slightly in that regard.  But you still have to decide if you really need some of the cleaner interface and faster scanning of these products, since there are free products that will do the same job and save you the annual subscription cost.  Also make sure that you know what features are most important to you.  If you need more control of your application firewall settings, you may want to explore the alternatives.

Good luck with your software purchase.

Enjoy.
