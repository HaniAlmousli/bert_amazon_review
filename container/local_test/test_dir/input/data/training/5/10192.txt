I really love this reading program and I use it for my 3 year old grandson whom I'm helping to learn to read.  The games are engaging enough that I can allow him to play independently for 10 minutes before I have to provide prompting.  It is easy to install on Windows 7; I haven't tested on any other platform though.  This shouldn't be solely relied on.  It's best if used a a supplement.  I would definitely recommend this reading program.  It provides a great start to learning to read.
