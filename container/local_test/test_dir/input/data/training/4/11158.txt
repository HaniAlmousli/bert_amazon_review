Norton has been around for decades - ever since Peter Norton wrote the Norton Utilities.  I have used Norton security before but took a brief vacation from Norton to try McAfee.  Bad idea!  McAfee is a pain to live with and the screens that keep popping up are very annoying.  It also seems to slow down your computer until it is like swimming through molasses.  Back to Norton, this is pretty much the same old product.  Far less obtrusive.  Does the job and regularly updates itself automatically.  One point - this is for a single computer.  If you have multiple computers &/or phones that you want to cover you should be aware that there are versions that cover 5 or 10 devices and that may be more economical for you.
