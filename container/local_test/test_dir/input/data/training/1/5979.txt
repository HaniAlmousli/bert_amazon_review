Fool me twice, shame on me!

Like the other people who reviewed this product it keeps crashing.  And crashing.  And crashing.  I didn't buy it from here.  Instead I bought it from the company itself as a download and have asked for a letter of destruction.  Twice.  So far...nothing.  However, I'm here to critique the product and not the manufacturer's LOUSY customer service, aren't I?

They tried to make it look like Office 2007/2010.  It does but it won't stop crashing.  I tried it on a 2 week old machine and an 8 month old machine.  Both run Windows 7 premium home, 64 bit.  Both handle other creation software without a problem.  When it didn't crash one time I did create a project.  There was a slight problem:  it only saved PART of my project.  That was rather irritating.

I also don't care for their search methods.  It isn't specific enough.

As my title says I keep wondering who their developers are.  I wrote a review on another product that also had issues.  It's almost as if they don't beta test their software enough or just ignore feedback.

If I had the money, ability, back-up and resources I'd create my own product and shut their business down because instead of getting better, they're getting worse.

Wake up Encore/Broderbund!  Your reputation stinks!
