I've played around with several video editing programs including offerings from Cyberlink, Corel, Adobe, Roxio, and others.  They all have pros and cons, but one of my favorites recently has been Cyberlink's PowerDirector due to it's intuitive user interface (esp. when compared with Adobe's offerings) and the fact that it is able to read and write to a wide variety of file formats (more than average).  PowerDirector has tons of features--many of which I have not gotten around to testing out yet, but this doesn't compromise the core operations that you will run on a regular basis--they are fast and stable (others have reported crashes, but I haven't had any issues yet).
