If you've been wanting to learn how to create your own website, but have either lacked the confidence or knowledge, this affordable combination book and video course will enable you to learn at your own leisure.  There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is "Certified Associate," approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.

With this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You'll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from "Adobe Certified Instructors", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.

For the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a "test" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.

If you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I'll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need. I've simply listed the few words under the contents and have tried to briefly explain what you'll be learning on the videos.
