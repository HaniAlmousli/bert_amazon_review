I use Premiere Pro and After Effects professionally and I state that upfront to make it clear that my expectations of PowerDirector are much lower. I expect something along the lines of Apple's iMovie, and hopefully better.

I installed this on one of my Windows 8.1 computers, an Asus laptop with a 17" screen, 8gb RAM, and a 1.83gHz Baytrail-M processor. A speed demon this is not, and its lack of a dedicated video card seriously slows down video processing. With that in mind, it's still hard not to get frustrated when PowerDirector lags and freezes, but keeping expectations in check, I find I am more annoyed with odd little bugs that happened frequently. The worst of these bugs was the play head, and accompanying video, jumping to the end of the video timeline while the audio played where it should be. This happened over and over while editing a video, making it impossible to preview effects and transitions.

But onto the good: PowerDirector keeps things pretty simple. Import your video, then click to select and drag the clips you want onto the timeline. Once there, video is easily trimmed simply by dragging from either end of the clip to shorten the video. Place the playhead where you want to cut a video and click "Split." The result is two pieces of the same video that can be moved or deleted independently.

I was initially a little thrown off once I'd trimmed my video to the needed lengths: where are all the video and audio editing tools? Turns out they're hidden away, sort of. Select a video and you'll note a banner of buttons appears above the timeline section. Most notable is the Fix/Enhance. Select this and what I was looking for is here - color correction, lighting adjustments, white balance, and stabilization. Each of these gives you deeper control over the image, but, at least on my computer, they can be slow to apply (and un-apply in order to see the difference.) Here is where Premiere shines - each effect has its own on-off switch while PowerDirector only toggles all of the changes made in a given section. It's not the worst thing, but it does make things just a tad more frustrating.

Stabilization is handled quite well, correcting a very wobbly bit of video with very little of the sloshy effect that stabilization can have.

There are transitions galore, from the basic fade to 3D. Select one, drag it down to the point that it needs to be utilized - and this is much more fiddly than I've experienced before. It needs to be placed right at the very beginning or end to snap into place. Anywhere else and you have to go back and reselect it. There is very little forgiveness when it comes to placing transitions in PowerDirector. Zooming in on the timeline using the slider in the lower left of the program may help with this.

Exporting your video is done through the Produce pane, and you are offered a plethora of choices here. Many different formats and settings for each one. This could be overwhelming for a new user. PowerDirector defaulted back to the original file format here, why I don't know - I don't want it back in a format for the camera. Also available here are direct uploads to favorite video hosting sites - YouTube, Vimeo, etc. I simply exported my video as mp4, and a 12-minute video is going to need a bit over 2 hours to render.

I wouldn't choose PowerDirector over Premiere, but at home, for simple video editing, it's a decent enough program. Apple iMovie keeps things simpler, but PowerDirector offers more options, but it's pretty close in approach. Were the choice up to me, I'd probably choose Premiere Elements because not only does it have a familiar interface for me, there is a lot more online user support for Premiere than PowerDirector. Sometimes being able to easily track down help makes all the difference.
