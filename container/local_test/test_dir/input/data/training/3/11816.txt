Just because it says Deluxe does not mean that it includes state anymore.  TurboTax could have done a better job at making their packaging differentiated for ones with and without a state return.  It was my mistake to assume.

TurboTax as a brand has always been reliable for me.  There have been many years in the past where I have not had a tax professional and I have used their software to do my returns.  I have never had any trouble with installation or use of their tax preparation products.  It is a more inexpensive alternative than going to someone if you have pretty straight forward tax return needs.
