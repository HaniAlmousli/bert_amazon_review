We switched over to them after Turbotax decided they didn't value their customers and could screw them last year by removing a feature that had been in for years and trying to tell us all it was to serve us better.  Hey Intuit you lost a customer of about 15 years doing that you morons!  So we got it and H&R Block imported things just fine last year.  It took a little getting used to, but no real issues.  It was no better or worse from a functional standpoint than the more expensive Turbotax, though the help files were slightly more cumbersome.  Nothing major.

Does it work?  Yes, it's fine and we had no issues doing our taxes with mortgage, minor stock dividend stuff, and some forms like W-G for gambling winnings.  Is it as good as Turbotax, well no.  It's not quite as polished and doesn't look as slick.  For example, updates aren't as seamlessly hidden as with Turbotax.  I even got a disturbing error message after the last program update.  I'm sure it's still fine, the program doesn't seem to be acting differently, but the last thing you want is a glitch in your tax software.  Probably going to wait for the next update on 2/15/16 and see if it gives any errors then.  Frankly, I'd just rather wait for updates in the first couple months on any tax software before submitting anyway.

So yeah, for cheaper cost and a company that I don't think is going to turn around and try to screw me, if only because they are a distant second in market share, it's well worth the money.  I have no qualms about suggesting it for anything but the most complicated of tax returns.

--Update 02/10/16--
I got the same error again for the state tax return.  It read No TaxDataStoreHandel found for TaxDataStore (see TaxDataMgr::getTaxDataStoreHandle()).  Not good since this is the second time.  I checked their support and they said to make sure anti-virus, firewall, etc. are off, no Windows Updates pending, and such, but I could tell it wasn't one of those.  Their help site wording is a little ambiguous, but did ultimately point me in the right direction after a couple minutes.  Go to Tools/Update the Program, click Next, then the hyperlink for What's included and which forms are final in the current state update?.  Browser will open and scrolling down will lead to the manual update area.  Couple more click and done deal.  No errors after updating that way.
