They do not make a Mac version so I had to buy the PC version. That was painful because my $3,000+ Mac was unsuitable to prepare business taxes. So, I exportedQB data into a Window version, loaded the file on my old PC and continued working. Every year for the last seven years or so I have used Quick Books and Turbotax to prepare and file my business taxes. Every year the QB balance sheet never matched imported balance sheet data in TurboTax. Although the Federal Government does not need the Balance Sheet, the New York requires it. So, I ignored that the Balance Sheet data were not matching and filed the taxes. If New York State wants a Balance Sheet, I will mail the one printed from my QB.

It is rather sad that even though QB, Quicken, TurboTax software all developed by Intuit, they have this issue that still is not addressed. I have brought it to their attention every year.
