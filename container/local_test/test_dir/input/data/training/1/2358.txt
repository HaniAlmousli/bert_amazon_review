There is absolutely no reason to buy this product.  Stick with XP and wait and see how Windows 7 does when released this year.  Vista adds some eye candy that you can get for your xp system for free or a small fee.

It does add heaches, UAC (goggle that one and check the number of problems), terrific bloat, system slow down, driver issues, software issues,etc...

Also take a look at the people giving 4 and 5 stars and then listing a host of problems.
