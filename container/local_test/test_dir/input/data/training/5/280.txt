I have owned this NAS for almost a year now and actually purchased a second one.  It works flawlessly and QNAP live tech support is superb. There is also a fairly comprehensive forum for users as well. I have slowly upgraded my capacities as newer larger capacity drives have come out on the market.  All have been recognized and the space expanded without a hitch. I highly recommend this product.
