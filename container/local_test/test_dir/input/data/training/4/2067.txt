This is a very good product but you need to integrate it with the other Microsoft 2007 products.  Microsoft 2007 products are designed to run on powerful PC.  If you do not have one, any of the products will run but slowly.  These products are designed to be installed as a group usually under Vista.  Once more, if you are not doing this, problems are possible.  Lastly, with any new product functionality has changed.  Microsoft considers it to be improved.  What you and I think can be something else.  All the functions are there.  Some moved and some are in another product.  I am relearning Microsoft Office 2007, Outlook 2007 and 64-bit Vista.  This can be unpleasant, time consuming and frustrating. If you work through this, you will have the "state of the art" version of the product.
Microsoft 2007 products are designed for ease of use.  Outlook 2007 has largely done this.  The product requires a learning curve but has rewards for those that spend the time learning the new interface.  BCM is not for causal home use but is invaluable for a home based or small business.  This is a good product with many benefits if you have the PC, operating system and other 2007 products.
