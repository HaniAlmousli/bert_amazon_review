Be ready for major frustration.  Windows 8.1 embeds Internet Explorer 11 which uses Shockwave Flash Object.  When Shockwave Flash Object is enabled, Internet Explorer continually freezes and give the dialog box "Internet Explorer Has Stopped Working."  Sometimes it will recover the webpage, sometimes not.  This may be avoided by disabling the Ad-on Shockwave Flash Object.  However, then, some videos, including some videos on Facebook will not load.  And, some entire websites will not open.  Consequently, one is forced to repeatedly enable and disable Shockwave Flash Object.  Before discovering this problem, my frustration was even greater, IE 11 continually froze up, and I did not know why.  Clearly, Microsoft should have cleared the bugs from Windows 8.1 before taking it to market.

Note, I just discovered that IE 11 would not post this review with Shockwave Flash Object disabled.  I had to enable it to complete the post.
