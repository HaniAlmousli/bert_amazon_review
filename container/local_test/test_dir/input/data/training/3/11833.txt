As a long time user of TurboTax online and desktop version, it's usually on the money.  It's straightforward with great guidance, especially to someone new to preparing their taxes.  I usually don't have a situation where I'm left wondering what to do.  It does a great job of answering all questions for my particular needs.  This was my first time using the desktop version in over five years.  While I like it and it offers the same TurboTax feel and routine, there are many advantages to TT online that will likely have me back there next year.  The single biggest advantage of the online version over the desktop is easier access to prior year returns.  You log into your TT account and there are all of your prior tax returns are available on demand for download as needed.  With the desktop, you save the tax file locally and need the program to re-open it.  So make sure you hold onto that disk for as long as the return may be needed.  You can export a PDF copy of your return but even that isn't as easy as simply logging onto your account and downloading your return.  Another advantage is easier importing of the prior year's data into the current year's return.  The last advantage, another biggie, is the real-time updates the online version receives.  Granted, the desktop version will check for last minute updates just before finalizing the filing but it feels more seamless and reliable online.

There are five federal e-files included with TurboTax desktop but state returns cost $40 additional.  I use my free state online filing because not only is it cheaper but it seems to be a bit more flexible and state specific than TurboTax state.

This year was a little odd.  It's the first year where I feel that TurboTax may have left some meat on the bone. I have several expenses that I've been advised were deductible that TT failed to credit.  I ran the numbers through both the desktop and online versions and neither considered the expenses deductible.  I very well could have gotten bad info but it was from a knowledgeable financial source.  Considering the fact that I'm still receiving updates to TT regularly when I use it, I decided to play it safe and have an accountant look over my return.  Sometimes, nothing beats a human, especially if interpretations or definitions may differ.  This is honestly the first time I've felt unsure of TT.  This is also a more complicated return than usual.  I have no reservations about returning to TurboTax next year.
