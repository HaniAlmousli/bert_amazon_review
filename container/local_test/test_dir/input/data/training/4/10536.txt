In addition to reviewing entertainment products for Amazon (CD, DVDS, Books), in my normal daily life I'm a CPA and tax preparer. I've been using H&R Block  software for at least 20 years. It used to be called TaxCut (and I actually liked that name better.). There are two basic Tax Software companies - H&R Block and Turbo Tax by Intuit). I find that H&RB is somewhat cheaper and more user friendly. There are three levels of the software. In H&RB's case, it is Standard (Federal only), Deluxe (with and without state - but if you live in a stare with a state income tax you should buy the with state combo - much cheaper than adding a state later) and Premium (which really is for more detailed help for self-employed people). If you know how to fill in a Schedule C then you can use the Deluxe too. There are just more "interview" questions in Premium. I use the Deluxe.

Though I'm reviewing H&RB here, I'll point out helpful info for those who have used TurboTax in the past. If you have any need for Sched D - capital gains or capital gains dividends - you will need to buy the TT fancier version this year. The Basic version doesn't allow you to do a schedule D. This is another reason to use H&RB.

Now the reason I downgraded it from 5 stars is that you only get ONE State filing with either the Deluxe or Premium.  If you live in one state and work in another, you will need to buy (via download) an additional state module. This now costs $34.95 per state which is actually the same list price as the Federal& State package. And you can find the Fed & State on sale often. (Amazon had - as it did last year - a one day sale on January 2nd at 55% off. But there is no way to save on those additional states. Personally I think H&RB is getting greedy there. I think Turbo Tax does the same thing - but has a higher list price.

If your return is simple then by all means use the software. But you might want to also check out local CPAs, who have tax training, and see what their rates are.  It may not cost that much more than the time and effort you spend using either H&RB or TT, and they will be able to offer you support too and offer suggestions.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
