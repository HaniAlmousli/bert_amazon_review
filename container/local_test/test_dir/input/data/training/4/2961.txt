As others have noted, Clipart&More "3.5 Million Clipart, Fonts, Photos, & More" is not really all of that great for direct installation on the computer, but it does included a very worthwhile one year subscription to their web site that has some 7.8 million clipart images, fonts, sounds, photos, and videos. We produce a lot of advertising, brochures, and signage for our small business and having access to this many graphics is very helpful.

The quality of the media from the site ranges from very basic to professional quality and is fairly easy to search and access once you sign up.

Recommended, but only for the on-line content.
