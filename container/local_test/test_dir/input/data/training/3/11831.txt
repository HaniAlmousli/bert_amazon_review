This is the same TurboTax Deluxe as we had for 2013 and earlier filing years, with Schedules C, F etc functionality.  Gone is the 2014 disaster - which was awkwardly corrected by Intuit - where they removed functionality yet called the product "Deluxe".  Intuit did listen to all of us who complained and has now kept the product version names consistent.  (If you missed my review last year of the 2014 product, take a look here: http://www.amazon.com/review/ROS6R0SV2H27M/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYXTCGY&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=229534&store=software )

Previous year's return imported just fine, and the interview and forms process is as prior years, simple to follow and thorough.  I did try H&R Block last year when Intuit made a mess of the 2014 Deluxe version - and wrote up an entire page of things that H&R Block did wrong or completely missed compared to TurboTax.  I would never consider H&R Block for a slightly complicated return based on that experience, however the TuroTax interview process guides you through all kinds of situations with ease.

I bumped a star because of Intuit's greed with the pricing of this product which does NOT include a state return.  I just paid $39.99 via an in-product purchase to add my state ... yet the Federal & State product costs only $10 more - not $40.  Total rip off.  Do note that I received this Federal product free via the Amazon Vine program for review and had I purchased, I would have bought the Federal + State which is my typical product.  But, I can imagine folks accidentally picking up this box (or download) and then having to purchase their state add-on at Intuit's rip-off price.

Edit:  I just bumped another star for bugs.  I've downloaded at least 3 program updates since the release of this product, yet it is NOT ready to do your taxes (or tax estimates as I'm doing).  I've completed numerous (estimated) 1099-MISC data entries - which shows a positive amount of income when looking at the forms - but the amount shows as $0 (zero) in the interview "Income Summary" column and shows an unexpected number in the 1040 in forms view.  I fully expect Intuit to fix this and any other bugs in time for filing - but this sloppy behavior for something so simple, and which worked in prior years, is kind of inexcusable.
