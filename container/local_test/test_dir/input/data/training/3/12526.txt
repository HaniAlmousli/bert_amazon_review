I know this is an older out of date version. I just wanted to write a post that the newer Toast 12 is much better than this one and has resolved a lot of the issues associated with less than a good experience. I have been running Toast 11 for several years and it works, but you have to be patient with it and know some of the work arounds to get it to do what you want. Check out Toast 12 it is much better and current as of the time of this review.
