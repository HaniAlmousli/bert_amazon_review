As the informed customers in the crowd are probably aware, Intuit (the makers of TurboTax and Quicken products) released their TurboTax products for 2008 with a new pricing structure and much less flexibility than had existed in previous year's products when it came to allowing customers to work on multiple tax returns.

Apparently, if the news at C-Net is correct, Intuit has backed off on those fees and is 'responding to customer feedback and concerns' and going back to old rules when it comes to the product.  I guess the marketing genuises and/or bean counters at Intuit didn't do enough research on how the mob with the pitchforks would react upon hearing the news of the changes in the rules for product usage this year.  (It's not like pollsters ever get things wrong, right?)

I expect that Intuit got feedback along the way that said that the pricing change and restrictions on the product usage weren't going to be problems for most of their users.  Worst case that's what they heard from the product management team and others involved in helping to set prices and policy I'm sure.  To be fair, if they had given advance notice that the rules were going to be changing, customers may not have reacted (some would say over-reacted) to the changes so harshly, but unfortunately for many customers they weren't made aware of the changes until *after* they got boxed product home and were reading through the materials that came with it (or worst yet, until after they started using the product and bumped into the request to pay an additional fee).

This is just the next in a line of mis-steps made by management at Intuit/Turbo Tax when it comes to this product.  One would hope they'd learn their lesson once and for all, but I really am not sure they ever really will.

Will I use this year's product?  I honestly don't know.  I've been a loyal customer for many years, but they really have stepped in the stinky stuff this season and I'm just not sure I want to reward them (even if they have tried to make nice with customers).

Best of luck to purchasers of the product.

(New rating would probably be up in the 4/5 range if rating the product alone.  Unfortunately for the folks at Intuit, the ratings can't be changed after the fact the way the reviews can be edited)

Original scathing review left below:
Original review title: Increased prices+new fees+less flexibility=1 star

I've been a loyal TurboTax user for many years now, but over those years the geniuses at TurboTax have thumbed their nose at myself and other customers several times, showing outright disdain for their customers.

It's senseless to use the space here to complain about their past mistakes, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be raking them over the coals for getting greedy on prices for the 2008 version of this software.  The price increase (suggested retail pricing) of 33 percent is out of line.  Defenders of the product will say "but it includes free..." and that may be the case, but it's still that much more expensive to walk out the store with compared to last year. Lowering the fees in one place and making them up on the retail price just shifts money around needlessly and makes their software seem that much more expensive compared to competitors, or worse yet, compared to just getting plain old paper forms and doing taxes the old fashioned way.

Worse than the price increase though is that apparently TurboTax is tired of having their product used to do taxes for a whole family, or for friends of the family.  I sympathize with them in wanting to be paid fairly for their work, but they could have made things clearer on just how many returns the software could be used to manage/print/handle in the past.  Instead, they're now restricting the ability to do multiple returns with a single product and have chosen to do that on top of the increase in the price of the product.  Double whammy.

Of course the reviewers here at Amazon are making use of their review space to slam the product and protest these moves and as you can see I'm piling on too.

I like the product, but given the changes for the current year I'm seriously considering my alternatives.  Just how bad is TaxCut by comparison?  (From what I've heard of the product, it deserves a good hard look :-/)
