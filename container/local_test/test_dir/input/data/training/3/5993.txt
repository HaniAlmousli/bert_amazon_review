This new iteration of Corel PaintShop is far from the version I used more than a dozen years ago. Back then PaintShop was an intuitive and fun-to-use software.

I think it got bloated and unnecessarily complex. The only reason I can find to justify having to relearn the bulk of how the software works, is to keep the mind active so dementia doesn't set in. (And experts aren't even sure that challenging the brain actually helps!)

Difficulty with registration, poor and costly customer support, non-intuitive and overly complicated procedures all conspire to make me want to deep-six this software.

But here's what I do like: Photo Blend and Exposure Merge which allow the creation of a composite; the vignette feature; clarity, sharpen and soften abilities; photo edges - those are just a few - but I fear they fail to compensate my time and energy wasted trying to get started. Certainly not fully recommended.
