This is my first year filling out taxes with Turbo Tax. I choose this option because I tend to put it off till the last second the manual way. It took about 2 hours (with interuptions and fumbling through paper work) for me to fill out both FED and STATE taxes, and for the most part it was relatively stress free.

I did end up downloading an out of state tax form by mistake (costing me 36 dollars). Hopefully next year's program will be smart enough to download the correct state forms automatically after analyzing the federal information. However, after a frustrating half hour trying to find Turbo Tax's phone number ( 1.800.4INTUIT), I called and recieved a refund (without a hassle).

I still ended up paying more by e-filing my state and federal taxes (which cost 17 dollars each). I think it is a bit deceptive that they promote the e-file feature without mentioning the extra charge.

I will give it another shot next year.
