I got a virus using Nortons, and since then I have had several friends have the same thing happen.  We all do updates and do not open attachments, so I really recommend anything but this!!
I have a friend that runs a teaching school for computers, and he said he had trouble with all the machines running Nortons getting viruses.  He changed to Panda and has not had the first antivirus since.
I have been running AVG I have had none of the problems, same with my friends.
