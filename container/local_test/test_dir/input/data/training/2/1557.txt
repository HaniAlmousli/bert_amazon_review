I used Turbo Tax for many years and every year it got better and better.  Then I tried Tax Cut for two years in a row and was surprised how much clumsier of a program it was to use.  I even ran into situations where I had to override TaxCut's built in methods to get certain things done correctly.  I've never had to do so with Turbo Tax.  I finally wrote on my file folder where I collect receipts for the coming tax years "Do Not Buy Tax Cut" so that I wouldn't forget.

If you are doing a simple tax return then almost any software will do, but if you have a more complex return with rental properties, investments, trusts or anything else beyond normal wage and salary income and the common deductions then TurboTax is IMO the way to go.

If your needs are fairly straightforward, then saving a few bucks by getting TaxCut might be OK.
