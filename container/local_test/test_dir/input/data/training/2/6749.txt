I do a lot of photo and video editing and have never had a program this unstable. It crashes often, particularly when editing titles or menues. The good news is that when it works, it is decent for video editing and DVD production. It's capture features are average. Also, when it crashes, it restarts to where you were in the editing process with minimal loss of progress...just lost time. If Pinnacle fixed the stability, I would give it 4 stars at least. I would note that I have a fast computer that is otherwise stable as a rock, and completely up to date, both drivers and software.
