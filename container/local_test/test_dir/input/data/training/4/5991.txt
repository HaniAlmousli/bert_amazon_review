It really took a great deal for Corel to pry my fingernails off my old version of PSP (PSP 7, when it was still being produced by JASC).  PSP has long been regarded as the poor man's photoshop and back in the mid 90's, the program was free. Registered copies where you could purchase plug-ins that were also inexpensive. Because I never liked Corel Draw, I had some very serious reservations about how well Corel would do after acquiring the product from JASC.  I have to confess, I was pleasantly surprised - mostly.

Corel's PSP 10  Ultimate is an affordable program. You can draw with it, retouch photos, and it includes tools that aid you in making your photos look like paintings with a minimum of time and effort. This was probably the main feature I did not want to part with.  The tabs for layers assist in the editing process.

The fact that there are so many tools and features can be a bit overwhelming.  Installation was fast and easy, and because I installed it to another HD, it did not destroy my ability to still use 7 if I wish.  I probably will never quite bring myself to stop using it from time to time.  Corel's new version of PSP be a bit slow, even on my Windows 7 machine with over a GB of RAM.  Still, Corel has managed to create a very affordable option as a graphics and photo enhancement program with a minimum of glitches from the last release.
