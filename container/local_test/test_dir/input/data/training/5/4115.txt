Now I have written many reviews on all kinds of different security software. If you've read some of them you may recall that Trend micro (which I had previously used for about 5 years) isn't one of my favorites any longer due to how much space it requires on your hard drive as opposed to other brands & being slower BUT all in all, it still works pretty good.
Now the advantage of having Trend Micro on a USB drive is that not only can you use it on different computers BUT now it will not take up any valuable space on your hard drive. That is especially nice for netbooks which are extremely limited in hard drive space. Now like I said previously, it does work fine but it really isn't as fast as other competitors like Kapersky & Vipre, but then again you have to install them to your computer. So, Trend Micro does protect you from viruses & in this format, on a USB drive, it saves valuable space on your hard drive IF that is a concern for you (like my son who has a netbook) this is a pretty good deal but......... there are faster security programs out there IF space is not a factor!
