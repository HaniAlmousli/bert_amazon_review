What I mainly want from my antivirus software is for it to do its job, and shut up and leave me alone. :-) By that, I mean that I don't want it asking me for input all the time, or interrupting me when I'm trying to do something. I'm definitely satisfied with McAfee on that front. It's pretty unobtrusive. I assume it's doing its job -- antivirus software is one of those things that, if it's working properly, you don't really notice. I do appreciate that this package includes protection for all of your devices -- cell phone, tablet, etc.

I find it very silly that I was sent a physical box in the mail, which contained a sheet of instructions and a card with a download code. That's pretty wasteful, guys. Just e-mail it to me!
