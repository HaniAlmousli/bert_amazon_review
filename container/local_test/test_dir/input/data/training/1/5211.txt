This year we opted to use H&R Block Premium & Business instead of TurboTax Deluxe and TurboTax Business, due to the many problems we have encountered with TT software year after year.  At first, we thought the H&R Block software was less buggy, and had less problems, although the user interface and interview portions are somewhat Spartan in their design.

Immediately after Efiling our 1040 return this evening, we noticed a glaring error in our HRB printed return.  The HRB software had calculated a lower refund that it should have - it opted to use the default option of the Itemized Deductions rather than the higher Standard Deduction, and our refund could have been $630 higher.  Put another way, nothing in the HRB software warned us to take the higher Standardized deduction and we missed the little check box as we passed through, and did not notice that the lower itemized deduction had been applied instead.

When I contacted HRB Support by phone this evening, they were apathetic, and did not seem to care about the problem I pointed out to them; about the obvious design flaw that should have been caught during the error check process at the end (as is the case with TurboTax by the way). I asked for the call to be escalated to a supervisor (Edwin) whose faux courtesy did little to soothe the pain that this is the first time EVER that we have had to file a 1040X Amended Return.  He REFUSED to ESCALATE my quality issue to the QC department and REFUSED to give me the contact number of the corporate office to report the problem we encountered, refused to have someone follow up by calling me tomorrow, and did not even provide a mailing address to write to the corporate office about an easy-to-fix problem, a problem that will cause us several extra hours of refiling the Amended 1040X return.  Also he refused to refund my purchase price or to honor their "Maximum Refund Guarantee" as detailed on their website.  Apparently, their guarantee is worthless, just pure marketing BS.

Bottom Line:  DONT BUY H&R BLOCK PREMIUM & BUSINESS!  They do not care about the quality of their software and they don't care about their customers either.  Worse, their Customer Support agents are poorly trained and incompetent know-nothings to boot.
