Capture cards typically came bundled with software for capturing, editing and producing video in DVD and other formats. The most common ones at the time were Pinnacle Studio and Ulead Video Studio. Ulead is now part of Corel, and is sold as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corel-VideoStudio/dp/B00BFYEH8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corel VideoStudio</a>. That product has evolved quite a bit, and is still a good choice. I reviewed it separately as part of Corel Photo Video Suite X6. Pinnacle evolved quite a bit too, and this version is a departure from previous versions. I never used version 16, but compared to version 15 and below, this version has a substantially different interface. Its old one was centered around the paradigm of the steps mentioned above, which was common for Video Studio and also for Cyberlink Power Director. Others such as Sony took a fresh approach, and this is a fresh approach for Pinnacle.

The new interface is cleaner and more powerful. I can now edit far more video tracks, rendering is much faster, and many features have been added. Unfortunately, while video editing software seemed to be the last software product around that still came with a hard copy manual, Corel has dropped it for both this and Video Studio. I suppose if you have a Kindle, you can get by with the PDF, but you most likely want your full computer screen for running the product itself. I found the PDF manual to be lacking, and some very simple things are not documented. Thus the learning curve was greater than I expected, even though once I learned it, it was easy to use.

The newest features are useful and practical, but there is also an increasing array of features that go far beyond what I'll ever need. In past versions, I often failed to see why I need hundreds of new transitions and more title backgrounds than I'd care to look at when I'll only use a handful, but if you are looking for a special title slide or want to have effects similar to the wipes, fades, pans, folds and spins of an over the top sports broadcast, you can do that too.

The product is still well suited for getting those old Digital8 or MiniDV tapes off the shelf and putting them on line, but it's even better suited to giving you the features necessary to work with your full HD videos and render things in any popular format or burn to a Blu-ray disc. It will also handle 3D videos. It won't handle subtitles the way Cyberlink will and you'd have to rely on standard titles for that. But the interface is much cleaner than something like Cyberlink's, which tries to upsell itself.

I've found it particularly useful when multiple video cameras are used at the same event and I wish to cut from one angle to another but have a cohesive video with no breaks in action or dialog. But the same editing capabilities come in handy even with lesser quality video, and my video review shows how I was able to salvage bits and pieces of videos to come up with something better.

Whether you merely want to take a collection of video clips and put them together, adding transitions and little more, or whether you want to edit multiple videos together with fancy titles rolling credits and Blu-Ray disc menus with a different moving background for each scene selection, you can do it with this product. The PLUS version of the product doesn't have all the features of the Ultimate version, so I suggest you check the feature comparison chart. I suspect that for most users, this will work fine, especially if you save your videos on your computer or want to watch them on line. If you want to burn things to Blu-Ray disc or want support for 4K ultra HD, the Ultimate version will be better for you.
