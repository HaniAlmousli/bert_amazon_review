I can't speak to the validity of the product this software produces in any state or DC. But in the end, I really don't care. That may sound strange, but allow me to explain.

I recently had my will (and associated documents) updated at my local Legal Affairs office (I'm retired military) in anticipation of a very serious bit of surgery. Fortunately, all went well and all the docs we had prepared can go back into storage until our next review date (or need).

The documents that were generated for me by the Legal Affairs office were comprehensive and both my wife and I were pleased. In the event something unfortunate had happened we were well-prepared and legally-armed to deal with what may have come.

Surgery in the rear view mirror and now on the road to hopefully a relatively full recovery I finally have had the opportunity to go through and try Quicken WillMaker 2014. All I can say is that I am amazed. Absolutely comprehensive, it not only generates the documents provided by the Legal Affairs office, it also generates a checklist for caregivers and survivors that floored me and my wife as to its thoroughness. The generated "final arrangements" document is also superior to what I had thought was an already superior "final instructions" document prepared by Legal Affairs.

Certainly, if you are using this software to generate a legally-binding will (or other document) and are concerned about the validity of the document (or are annoyed because your locality will not accept it/them as legally-binding), you might arrive at a different conclusion than I have. But my wife and I are using this program to be better educated and prepared the next time we update our wills (whether we choose to use a lawyer or once again avail ourselves of the local Legal Affairs folks). Bottom line, I've paid far more money for a specialty book on subjects like this and gotten far less information than is provided by this product.

The program also comes with an abridged "Legal Answer Book For Families" (paperback), a downloadable .pdf "NOLO Encyclopedia of Everyday Law" (following a fair and unobtrusive registration process), and one year's on-line access to tools that can be used to create a living trust.

Summary: 5 stars (even if you cannot use the software to generate a legally-binding document, the educational value alone makes it well worth the money you'll spend on it).
