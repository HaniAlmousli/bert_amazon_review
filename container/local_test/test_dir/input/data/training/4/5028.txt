I happen to already have a subscription to Ancestry.com and periodically work on a tree that I created there, so I was already familiar with the main features of this program and found it easy to operate.  To a person new to the program, though, I think that there would be a bit of a learning curve, simply because of the volume and variety of data the program has to work with.

I was able to import my current Ancestry.com tree into Family Tree Maker without a problem.

This type of program can become highly addictive, especially since you get the three months of access to Ancestry.com and you soon realize that the amount of information out there is vast.  You'll find yourself meandering down a side shoot of your family, trying to track it as far as you can.  The difficulty I have, though, with the search program is due to the fact that most of my folks came over from Eastern Europe and the translations of the Cyrillic alphabet into the English one varies from document to document, so their names and addresses aren't always spelled the same.  But if your ancestors are from Western Europe, your search will be much easier.  I've managed to track an English ancestor back into the 1700's.

This review is about an older version of the program which is no longer available, but if you're at all interested in your family history, I would highly recommend getting a current version of the program.
