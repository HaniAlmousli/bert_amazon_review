The recent sale of this on amazon for $30 made it a easy to justify purchase.
Even MS's student pricing was like $80 or $90, the last time I bought Office 2007.

I'm not a power user, but I did want a PDF creator in my next office suite.
Wordperfect's pdf utility does everything I need.

So far I have been able to open my old MS word doc's and spreadsheets without problems.
(sometimes the formatting was a bit skewed, but was fixable).

For anyone that has problems reading files created by competing products,
I have always used Quick View Plus by Avantstar. Quick view Plus can open over 300 different file types for viewing.
