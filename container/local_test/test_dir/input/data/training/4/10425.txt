We got this software this year after Turbotax pulled their funny business with dividend payments.  The software is a bit rougher than Turbotax, but was quite adequate for our needs.  Short version, we're pretty much certain to go with H&R Block next year instead.  Intuit lost a 10+ year customer.

If this is your first time doing your own taxes you might want to use other software.  There was one point where I either missed it, it wasn't clear, or it skipped it, that I wouldn't have got my DMV deductions in if I hadn't known to go back.  It also doesn't show all the totals as conveniently as Turbotax did.  It also had some problems with auto-run on the disc, but I just went to the DVD drive and start up the installer automatically and it had no glitches.

On the other side, it's cheaper, they offer some stuff included like the free in person audit support that you pay quite handsomely for with Turbotax, though I have no experience to know if the other company's is better or not.  I had no real problem with the questions, my only little annoyances were mostly due to things being in different places or having to look a little more than with Turbotax.  Again, first time filers may not do as well with it, but if you've done it a year or two before it posed no problems.
