Many users are moving over from Vega, however, I'm moving over from a different software company altogether (Corel) and to be honest, didn't expect too much from this video editing suite. I was pleasantly surprised.

I mainly create short videos, mainly of the tutorial variety, and this had an easier learning curve than Corel. Don't get me wrong, though, there's still a steep learning curve, but at least the "help" is actually helpful.

The suite offers a slew of effects (many of which I'll admit to not having tried simply because they don't apply to me), but they do have the basic transitions one is likely to use--fade, cross fade, so forth--it allows for adding subtitles/close-captioning, and for doing voiceovers.

Finally, rendering video was relatively speedy. To render a 15min. mpg took less than 5 minutes which was delightful, and the couple hour long features I needed to edit required about 30 minutes apiece. Your mileage may vary. While this may not be a Hollywood grade editing suite, it will certainly meet basic needs for short videos, especially of the home or to-be-viewed-on-youtube variety.
