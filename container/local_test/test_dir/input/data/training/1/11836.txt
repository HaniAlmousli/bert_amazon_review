TurboTax Deluxe 2015 does NOT include Schedule E or D.  For these forms, which are required for rental properties and capital gains/losses on stock sales, the Premier version is needed, and it costs $20-30 more.  Have a look at H&R Block for substantially less money for similar functionally as Turbotax.
