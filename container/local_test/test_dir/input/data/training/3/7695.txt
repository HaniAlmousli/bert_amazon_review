I've run several small businesses (sole proprietorships), doing my own accounting and tax preparation for well over 20 years. I've expanded into a new business that includes a number of not-quite-employees, people I pay commissions to and need to 1099 at the end of the year. I also now have inventory to track. Enter the need for better accounting software to handle these added tracking issues without taking up too much of my time.

QuickBooks in the name to look toward for just such accounting needs... But starting from zero, with no previous QuickBooks knowledge, I'm finding it a steep climb to learn and use, and a time-consuming one at that. It is not an easy or intuitive start-up program to use.

Odd thing that strikes me, that may not bother those more familiar with the program, is the lack of ability to simply enter expenses and in a simple "expense" area, and tag them with the IRS standard categories I'll be entering for taxes at year's end. Instead this sort of entry seems to fall under "vendors." It seems to me a cumbersome way to go about what should be a simple entry, for example, for office supplies, whether I happen to buy printer paper at the grocery store or make a special trip to the office supply store.

I found window tabs and window resizing to fit my notebook computer cumbersome and sometimes difficult. The registration and setup process - while I had no major problems - did at points cause me difficulty because some popup windows had no scroll bars and ran off the bottom of my notebook screen, so I couldn't get to the "submit" buttons.

I was disappointed to be confronted immediately by it wanting a credit card to use the payroll part. I want to try things out and evaluate before committing to paying for upgrades. Without the credit card entered, with automatic renewals, I couldn't look at the employee payroll thing to see if it fit my needs, or if the cost to do 4 to 6 employees (who aren't really even 'employees') made it worthwhile.

Point to QuickBooks for having a "Help" section with writing in words, not just videos (they have videos, too). I HATE having to watch several minutes of videos only to learn it didn't answer my question (I just tried and rejected another accounting software service primarily because their help was *only* videos). But the help windows are tiny and do not resize, and the font is tiny, hard to read, and does not resize unless I resize my entire computer display sizing (really? for one program that lacks suitable adaptive ability?).

I'll keep working on it all, hoping familiarity creates a better reaction.
