I have tested several versions of Quicken and Turbotax over the last several years.
I enjoyed every moment and helped Intuit release a very clean product.

Quicken 2013 has improverd the user interface to help you take your financials in hand.
I updraded every year and have used Quicken since 1998, every upgrade brings more and more inovations.
Q13 is no different, more popups by hovering over your accounts, bring you snap shots of the account.
Q13 has improved your comtrol with "New" Mobile Apps, automatically makes a budget by analysing your speending habits.
This feature allows you understand where you money is with the click of a mouse.

I use the Deluxe version becuase it offers the most control for my life. If own a home business, a small business or have rental properties the Premier version will bring a new confidence to your financial life.

I will add more as my use contines....
