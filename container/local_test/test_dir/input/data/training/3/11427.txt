Wow, some serious mixed reviews....
I am not a pro at this software, but have spent a few days with it...
and, I like it, but don't love it yet.
What I am amazed about, is how good my phone voice recognition works, but yet, these software programs are way more sophisticated, but yet, not as accurate.
However, the first think I did was... I upgraded my microfphone to a decent external mic, and this improved errors a LOT!
then, I experimented with how I speak into the mic... distance to the mic, speed of speech, annunciation, etc.
You have to speak very clearly, precisely, and not too fast.  I think with time, I will get better...
but I can understand some of the neg reviews, as many phones have such good voice recognition... so u would expect a product dedicated to that task would be even better...  I also think the type of English you speak matters... slang, accents, speed would prob. effect the outcome dramatically.  I would say, most of the errors are sensible errors, i.e. I understand why they occurred.  But, it is annoying having to correct the type often.  Like any new tool, it takes time to master it, so I felt my rating was fair for a newb...its not perfect plug n play, but if you type all day, and can make this work, its well worth the investment.

I hope to perfect this more and more, as I am tired of typing all day...will try to update in due time...
