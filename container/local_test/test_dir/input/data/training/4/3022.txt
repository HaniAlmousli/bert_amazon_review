I have already reviewed and voiced my concerns about the actual programs like Excel, Word, PPT et al, and their problems in another review.  In short, this edition is only for children, people who have never used MS office before, or those using it only for the most basic of functinoalities.  Professionals, those used to versions 2000-2003, and those who need expert control of the program (i.e. macros and the like in Excel), then do not get this program, you'll have a tought time finding the same functionalities as in v. 2003.  But, since this is the special media edition, I did enjoy this one part of MS Office 2008.  It really does an excellent job of organizing all of my HD videos and photos, hence I give it 1 star over the regular version (which I rated a 3).  The visual interface of being able to see what files you are actually organizing instead of just icons and numbers really helps group the pictures and videos into exactly what I need, this is really a neat feature.  You can actually "preview" each media file without opening it, again saving you the time of figuring out what you are organizing.  Make sure, however, that you have more than the minimum system requirements for this special part of MS Office.  I put this version on one of my computers, I had more than enough RAM and processing speed, and the preview part would take up a lot of RAM, slowing down my computer quite a bit!!!

I'd reccomend staying with an earlier office product, and waiting for a new one to come out that is hopefully better for business professionals.  Creative individuals or those in the creative work profession will probably not have ad tough of a time with this edition of office as I did.  Those who need hard-core number crunching capabilities of Excel will have a very difficult time with this new version.
