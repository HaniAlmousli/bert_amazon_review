Corel Painter X3 is an amazing digital palette for digital artists. A large array of brushes and techniques, ability to choose your canvas textures, mix and match your styles, and so much more. This is in-depth artist software that goes beyond just digital painting.

I have fallen in love with Painter X3 already from my casual artist point of view. I can pull from my past experience from other graphic and photo programs with items such as layers, cut/paste, effects, etc. and work my art as I like with paints, pencils, pens, crayons, etc.

One of the great things I appreciate with Corel is that they post tutorial videos to help a newbie get started with their software. I NEEDED this to learn my way around the canvas and see how it all worked. I also appreciate seeing the different artwork people have created using Corel Paint. It can be quite inspiring.

One feature I have enjoyed immensely right away is the ability to take your favorite photograph and create a painting from it. I learned about photo painting from Corel's website when I was learning about what Painter X3 can do. This was the fastest way for me to get started painting  and familiarize with the abundance of brushes available.  The results have been very pleasing and I still manage to translate my own unique style into the work. The first couple works were rather rough, but as I learned more of the software, the better my photo painting was becoming.

Corel Painter X3 is fantastic and can make an artist giddy with all the toys available for the user, but the price will make you giddy too.  It's unashamedly pricey, not really practical for the casual artist. But if you can afford it Painter X3 is worth looking in to. Check out the video tutorials on Youtube and see for yourself what Painter X3 is capable of and if it's something you would like using.

I currently have Corel Painter X3 running on my Acer laptop  (AMD Phenom II with 4GB Memory) that is about 2+ years old running with an solid state drive, Windows 8, and Wacom Intuos 3 Graphics Tablet. Installation was a breeze. The program has run very smoothly so far. Occasionally I get an odd memory lag when I'm drawing, but it has never stayed around long enough to become an issue.

If price is not concern, Corel Painter X3 is more than worthy for consideration. It's painting plus more.
