After getting past some install issues with windows 8.1, I found the whole process of editing videos to be somewhat of a hassle compared to other programs I've used in the past such as windows movie maker or iMovie.  The UI was very hard to navigate and it was just time consuming trying to figure out the simplest of features.  Frankly, I just don't have the time to learn this software and regret the time sink I spent on it.
