I have to add a "ditto" to the other reviewers who were unhappy with this version of PrintMaster (the review by "Jenn" states it very well). The problem is how BUGGY this software package is... I'm a Microsoft Certified software developer by trade so I usually can understand programming quirks and can get around them, but I came across too many in this package to make it worthwhile. It's a shame, because there are a LOT of good features and an excellent stock of images and clipart (which you can still use) which is why I even gave it two stars, but the bugs in the user interface will get frustrating. I'm running this (or trying to run this!) on a new PC with an Intel i3 processor, Windows 7 Pro 64-bit, 4GB ram, GT240 video card and a 10K RPM Raptor hard drive with a second 7200rpm drive for files and assets. That's not as powerful as my video editing rig but it should be more than ample to make PrintMaster run like the dickens. I had high hopes for this software, but it just wasn't well-tested before they released it. Let's hope the next version comes out of the gate strong!
