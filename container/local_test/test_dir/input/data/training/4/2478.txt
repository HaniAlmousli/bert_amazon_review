At work, we just got the newest version of Microsoft Office with Windows 2007 update; I have to say that it is the worst and most confusing program I have seen. Word perfect is good for anyone who is familiar with the original Microsoft Office. It's compatible, almost exact in the interface and easy to use right out of the box, without having to read a manual. My only complaint is its price. Word Perfect Office offers an alternative to Microsoft Office, but it isn't cheaper. Unfortunately, most major institutions update their Microsoft, which means that you will need to learn the new office to be a viable candidate in our contemporary job market. However, for regular home use, Word perfect is a great and easy to use program with lots of great features.
