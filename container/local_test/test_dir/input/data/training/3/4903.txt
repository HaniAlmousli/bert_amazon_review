Like a spurned lover, I come back to Corel products repeatedly hoping that the sluggish software and poorly intuitive interface are finally resolved. Given the opportunity to try another Corel product free through the Amazon Vine program was too much for me to stay away.

But stay away I should have, and so should you, because this clunky collection of four programs are not a comprehensive suite but rather four separate coconuts lashed to the same raft. These are the four programs:

* Corel Paint it! (photo painting)
* Corel Photo Album 7 Deluxe (digital photo editing)
* Serif Digital Scrapbook Artist 2 (scrapbook creator)
* Serif PanoramaPlus X4 (panoramic pictures)

As glum as I sound, I can still recommend this package for new and beginning users who are not under tight production deadlines or need to rely on these programs to make a living.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corel-Create-it/dp/B003WVFAO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corel Create it!</a>&nbsp;is a hobbyist's best friend, an affordable package that allows users to explore these related programs without emptying their wallet (a prerequisite for most Microsoft programs).

In summary, the program is too slow and sluggish for experienced users who are likely to juggle more than two or three photos (or video clips) at a time. Corel needs to work harder at making their programs more intuitive.

Rating: Three stars
