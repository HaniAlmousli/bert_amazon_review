Every year I go out and by Turbo Tax for the convenience and that I can down load the information with ease from my quicken program.  This is a big plus in the programming and it's only benefit.  But I always wind up doing it by hand anyway.

In years past, turbo tax was issued and then a follow up final issue with all the information was added so if you waited until April, you would be assured to have the final version which allowed you to print and do your state taxes.  Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.  You have to go online to get the final versions.  What if you do not have online access?  Well then you have you have to call them and are not guaranteed to get any help that way.  The headache is not worth it..

Since the IRS puts all of its final laws into place in June, can't turbo tax and other software put out there final versions by December 1?  Since we are forced to pay taxes every year, shouldn't this be as complete as possible BEFORE they release it?  This way all we need is one program and not worried about getting on line or worried about new product information.

Consider other options until they fix this part of the programming.
