Seems fine as  a standard virus checker, but Does Not do well at all on detecting Malware. I had a case of malware infecting my computer and neither Norton antivirus, nor downloading and using the most current version of Norton Power Eraser could even detect it's presence. Only by "joining the Norton Community group" asking questions and following threads of discussion did I stumble upon a recommendation to locate an anti malware free download. This product worked quickly and effectively isolating the malware. So my surmise is Nortons antivirus techies are fine in their speciality, but in the malware detection and removal (and malware is becoming a significant Internet problem) the Norton program is deficient or lacking complete capability
