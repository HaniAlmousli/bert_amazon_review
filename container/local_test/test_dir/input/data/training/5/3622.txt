I've used Norton and AVG before trying this program, and I prefer this one.
Testing security software reminds me of the old joke about snapping your fingers to keep away tigers ("Does it work?" "You don't see any tigers, do you?"). An engineer friend suggested that I install it on one of my extra computers and intentionally infect it.
Lacking numerous extra computers or easy access to computer viruses, I had to content myself with installing it on the older of my home computers. It was simple to install. It immediately identified problems with some of my kids' downloaded music, which previous security software had failed to catch, and it healed the problems.
I've had two complaints about previous security software I've tried. First, they give scary announcements of problems and then sigh that they can't fix it. Second, when they run their scans and updates, they slow down the machine enormously. Since I work online, this matters to me. Neither of these problems has arisen with with McAfee.
