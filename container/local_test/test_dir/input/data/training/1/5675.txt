I was excited with the Black Friday sale price of $29.95, but this is no bargain if you want to include graphics/pictures in your PDF files.  Corel PDF Fusion uses very heavy compression with no user control over the image quality.  This is particularly obvious if you have an image that includes high contrast text, such as black text on white background.  You will get lots of compression artifacts and the text will be color tinges along the edges.  I use Adobe Pro at work and was not expecting this product to compare to that, but I thought I could at least include pictures in my created PDF without the image quality being reduced so greatly.
Don't every try to fill in a PDF blank form with this product because it IS NOT WYSIWYG.  Forms that appear fine on the screen will print with text fields chopped of or print as blank fields.  Attempting to edit the text field to reposition it on the form is like working in the dark.  You have no clue if your positioning/sizing has been done correctly until you print it again.  Maybe the worst piece of commercial software I have used in over 40 years in the business.
