I have been using Tutbotax for years.  Now I have begun ordering the online, downloadable version which enables me to get a copy the same day as I order and it works great. I like having the information I need to file without having to leaf thru the federal and state instructions, the review with recommendations and the free filing. The charitable deductions definition is useful too.
