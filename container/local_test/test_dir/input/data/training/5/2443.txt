There is no way that I could give the iLife suite anything but 5 stars.  I switched to the mac 1.5 years ago and have been intensely using iLife '08 for the entire time.  The suite of programs is just incredible.  I would probably pay upwards of $600 for the suite of programs, and it costs only [...].  Crazy.

The following review covers the new features added in iLife '09 that weren't in iLife '08.  There are a lot of new features, and I'll update my review after I spend time with each one.

iPhoto '09
FACE RECOGNITION: My iPhoto library is relatively small at 14,000 photos, most of which feature friends and family.  Because I'm a bit OCD, with iPhoto '08, I took the time to label all the photos with the names of the people contained in each picture.  I did this by writing the person's name in the "Key Words" field of each photo.  For a variety of reasons, my iPhoto library is much more valuable and useful to me when they are properly labeled with people's names.  As such, I was intrigued by the face recognition feature of iPhoto '09.  After allowing iPhoto '09 to scan my library of photos for faces (which took about 3 hours), I spent a handful of hours training iPhoto to know what everyone's faces look like.  This process (if you know how to do it) is indeed easier than the old way (of me typing in people's names in the "key words" field under each photo).  The facial recognition is pretty good, or maybe very good.  The problem I've discovered is that facial recognition is never going to be perfect.  Indeed some of the best photos have friends or family with their backs turned to the camera, or whatever, so facial recognition doesn't notice them.  If I were to rely solely on the facial recognition in iPhoto '09, I would fail to properly label all my pictures ... I'd miss some really really good pictures.  Then, months later, when I'm looking for a photo with my friend Sam, I won't be able to find certain photos, because it was never properly labeled with his name.  Long story short, I won't be using the facial recognition feature.  Instead, I'm going to continue to mark all my photos with names in the "key words" field of each photo.  Note also, the facial recognition feature cannot find the face of my parents' Dalmatian dog.

PRINTED BOOKS (MAPS FEATURE): the printed books that I've created with iPhoto '08 are amazing.  I've had several people say, "I've gotta get a mac" when they see the books I've made.  And, a few months ago, Apple announced that the pictures in the printed books are going to be even higher-res (haven't had a chance to print a book since the announcement), so the books should look even better now. A new feature in iPhoto '09 is the ability to add custom maps to your books.  For instance, I created a book with a map showing a travel line from NYC-Helsinki-Warsaw-Cracow-Budapest-Vienna-Prague.  The map looks awesome (see photo uploaded to amazon).  Printed books make the perfect gift or coffee table book.  (TIP: after you create the map, right-click on the map for additional advanced options (e.g., changing the connecting lines from _curved_ lines to _straight_ lines).  Criticism: while the large-scale maps (i.e., big city to big city to big city) look great, zoomed-in maps (i.e., of an individual city or town) have no detail.  (See the photo uploaded to amazon of my map of Warsaw, Poland).  Hopefully they'll fix this.

GEOTAGGING: this feature is so cool and totally belongs within iPhoto.  Years from now, when all the cameras have GPS built inside, it is going to be so convenient to have this metadata attached to photos.  That being said, I cannot imaging spending the time to label my 14,000 photos that don't currently have that data.  I did buy the "Amod AGL3080 GPS Data Logger," to carry with me on trips so that I can add GPS data to new pictures I take.  I haven't had a chance to use it yet.  Update: I've had a chance to manually geotag some pictures (e.g., this batch of photos is "Warsaw, Poland").  It's pretty easy to tag photos.  That being said, there's really nothing amazing about having geotagged photos.  Hopefully future iterations of iLife will make use of having geotagged photos and movies (e.g., smart slide shows or movies that automatically include maps that zoom into pictures, or something).

GarageBand '09
MUSIC LESSONS: this is the most exciting part of iLife '09 for me.  These lessons look _better than real lessons_.  Seriously, better than live lessons with a real human.  I started the guitar lessons a week ago, and I just love them.  I can do the lesson over and over, at my own pace.  Apple really slammed this one out of the park.  I can't wait until I get good enough to use one of the $5 artist lessons.  Note: there are 9 free introductory piano lessons, and 9 free introductory guitar lessons (the lessons feature an acoustic guitar, but they appear to be useful for learning both acoustic and electric guitar ... same principles).  Note: Garageband includes a tuner, so that you can tune your guitar via your mac's microphone.  Well, it sucks and is nearly useless. (I'm using my iMac's built-in microphone).  I'm glad I bought this tuner: Korg GA-30 Ultra Compact Guitar and Bass Tuner (it works for both my electric and acoustic guitar).

I'll update the review when I've had a chance to use the 1-2 dozen new features that are important to me.
