I've used Adobe Acrobat and PDFDocs.  Corel's PDF Fusion is easier to use than either of those programs and, while not as powerful as Acrobat, can do quite a bit in terms of manipulating and creating .pdf files.  The interface is fairly simple.  You can drag and drop files, change their order, and publish them to .pdf files.  You can split .pdf files apart, stitch multiple files together, etc., all in a fairly intuitive graphical interface.  It even provides a .pdf printer that lets you print any document (e.g., a Word document from within Word or a webpage in Chrome or Firefox) to a .pdf file.  It's an incredibly useful feature.

Given the ubiquity of .pdf files, it's helpful to have a program like this one on your computer.  This one is stable, plays nice with other software, and gets the job done.  And it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Check it out.
