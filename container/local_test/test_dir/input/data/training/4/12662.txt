I have been a long time user of this product. In fact, I have over 17 registered products with them. This version is incomplete and the basic function of syncing directories between computers does not work UNLESS you buy cloud space from Acronis. There are many, many folks out there that have reported this and other issues with this recent version.

I did ask for a refund, one of the RARE times I was so frustrated with a product that I went through the effort of asking. Predictably, I was told because I was outside of the 30 day window they could not accommodate me. Now, I have a proven track record over the years with their products, there is a wealth of other users that have the same issues I complained about and yet, they would refuse me the cost of their defective product in the hopes that I might stay for the next version or even an update of this version.

So, save your money, look for any of the other alternatives and stay away from the 2015 version of this app.
