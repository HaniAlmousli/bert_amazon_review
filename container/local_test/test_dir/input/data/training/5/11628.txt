It works fine on Windows 7. I've not tried it on the other computers in the house but I figure if it works good on 7 then it will work on others as well. It was an easy download and things went smoothly. There is a free trial version you can get from the company if you want to play with it awhile before deciding whether you want to buy one or not. If you are into taking movies at home, school, work, wherever, you will really love this and have a great time using it. I have used other programs before but this one is by far the easiest to use. It's best if you do the tutorial unless you are already familiar with how to do it. I have used others but since they are all different I tried the tutorial first and that made it easier for me. I wish this had all been around when my daughter was born because I would have loved to have videos of that time period. As it is the pictures are fading and the slides are obsolete and useless now. This would be great editing school ball games as well or those special moments like weddings. I love this program!
