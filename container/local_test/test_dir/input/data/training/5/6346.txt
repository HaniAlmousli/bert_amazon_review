Once again the H&R Block tax package made my job easy. Our taxes are fairly complicated, with a home office, a business, capital gains, itemized deductions, depreciation, mileage, and other tax details that can keep you on your toes.

Once our figures were compiled and in a spreadsheet, using this software had the taxes complete and ready to mail inside of two hours. Once upon a time I used to spend all day long, on the floor surrounded by piles of papers, with a calculator, extra copies of the tax forms, and a pencil. All of that is pleasantly, a distant memory.
