It's kind of a fun program.  My boys (3 & 5) love computer "games", and to them, this is something of a game.  The vocabulary lessons are presented in a manner of: here are some words, now you repeat them, now you answer which is which.  That seems to work pretty well.  I have not yet gotten to any grammar lessons yet, so I can't say anything there at this time.

One factor that I really like is that the program has TWO Spanish speakers, so that you can hear two different tones of voice and accents pronouncing the words.  We will keep using this, and I hope to come back and update this review when I have gotten to the grammar lessons.
