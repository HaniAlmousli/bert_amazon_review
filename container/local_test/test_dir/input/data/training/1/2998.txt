If you do any programming or statistical analysis with Office, stay away from this ripoff!!!  VBA and the Analysis Toolpak are gone -- and of course, you won't find this out until AFTER you've wasted your money!!!!!  Here's another wonderful feature: any graphics that you created for Powerpoint slides won't work in Office 2008.  Who knows what other nightmares are hiding in this pile of crap?
