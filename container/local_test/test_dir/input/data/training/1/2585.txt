So far, I am not impressed. It did arrive quickly, but it does not work for us. I followed the instructions to a "T" several times on several devices and it would not connect. I started skeptical because there is no product on Amazon that has 300 reviews and every one is 5 stars. This is literally the 2nd 1-star review (and I think the other person was wise for not purchasing).  I've grown even more skeptical and plan on returning this product unless someone from Opticover is willing to help out.
