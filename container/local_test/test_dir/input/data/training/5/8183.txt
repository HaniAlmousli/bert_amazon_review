Installs easily and offers online update option before the install.  It does offer a great deal of web protection as in it blocks malicious url's, etc.  Even does a scan of your facebook wall for those nasty third party softwares that can be dangerous to click on.  It also seems to do a pretty good job on malware cleanup.  Most antivirus programs do not focus very hard in this area.  The main window has 4 big buttons. of which one offers a scan - so you don't have to be bothered looking around for that if you need it right away.  You can also update it from there - although it seems to update itself quite efficiently and often.  Most won't need to mess with the configuration as it seems to already be configured with a good balance for protection and performance.  I haven't used it yet, but it also comes with bootable recovery options if you do get a bad infection.  I'm a true believer in free antivirus software, but most do not offer the same realtime protection as the paid ones.  Therefore, if you are going to pay for one, I'd almost always choose Norton.
