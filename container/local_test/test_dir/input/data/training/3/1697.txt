Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10 is packed full of features that you will come to love, but has one huge drawback -- the installation process is horrid to say the least.  I'd have no problems at all rating this a 4 or 5 star product if not for the installation woes.  However, once you get past that the program really excels in providing a full suite of digital media tools that are sure to please any Windows user.

One of the drawbacks to digital media, especially on the Windows platform, has always been how many programs you have to use to get something simple done -- such as create a movie and burn it to DVD.  With so many households using digital cameras and camcorders nowadays, the Windows platform has really lagged behind in having a tool set to help these digital households create, manage and share their media.  With Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10 you get a full arsenal of programs to help you make this task a little easier.

Home users want software that is simple and gets the job done.  I'm happy to say that Roxio fits this bill.  I've used a variety of programs over the years to manage and share my footage from my camcorder.  They all have worked reasonably well, but they never provided a complete package to work with.  In Roxio, I found a lot of tasks that were tedious to do with other programs -- such as adding overlay tracks with text or audio -- was a snap to do.  The first video I produced with Roxio, my review of the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Logitech-Cordless-Desktop-Wave-Set/dp/B000TKHGL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Logitech Cordless Desktop Wave Set</a>, took less than 10 minutes to produce.

However, this program suite is more than just a digital movie maker.  You will also find a wide array of tools to help manage your digital audio, create data CD's and DVD's (including burning ISO images) and programs to help you even manage content from your mobile devices!  For the price you pay you really are getting quite a bit of software to help you manage your digital tasks.

Another plus to this suite of programs is that it can grow to meet your needs.  You can start out simple, such as getting your video off your camcorder and making a simple movie with the CineMagic program.  As you get more familiar with video editing the program lets you control almost every aspect of it by giving you the controls to edit track-by-track, clip-by-clip and scene-by-scene.  Advanced users will like the ability to have total control over their media, while newcomers will enjoy the wizards and walkthroughs provided by the product.

Overall, Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10 is a great family of products that will help you take control over digital life.  The only thing to watch out for, and why I gave it three stars, is the installation process can be extremely problematic -- especially under Windows Vista.  Be prepared for extremely long wait times without any feedback as to what is going on.  Hopefully, Roxio will address these concerns and fix this problem to make this product worthy of 4+ stars.
