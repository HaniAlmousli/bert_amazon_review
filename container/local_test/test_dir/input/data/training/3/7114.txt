I've been using TurboTax forever.  Yes it gets a bit pricey but it works and I'm use to it.  Like the fact I can bypass the prompts and enter information directly on the forms and/or option screens.  The $19.95 to file a state return is expensive and in my case I need two state returns so having to pay another $40 for state software and then $19.95 for both states filing doesn't seem right.  Same price as both federal and state software, you get a $1 discount.  $20 would be fair but again bit of taking advantage of us long term Turbo Tax customers.  In the end the product works and I'm hooked so I guess I will keep funding them.
