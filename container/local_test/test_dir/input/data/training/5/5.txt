The video is well-paced and delivered in an understandable manner.  It allows you to work with the software while watching and following the directions of instructor Candyce Mairs.  To me, the book is more of a reference guide, something I would access with a specific need or question, because overall I learn better by seeing and doing than by reading.  The video starts with the basics and builds logically.  This is everything you want in a teaching video/book!
