I've been using Dragon Dictate for Windows for several years and I recently made the plunge in the Apply world with a MacBook.  for the most part I've found Mac versions of my most frequently used programs or a similar product. I was assuming I could simple switch to the Mac version of Dictate. Unfortunately the Mac version is not as mature as the Windows version. Simply put,  this current version is too buggy and erratic.
