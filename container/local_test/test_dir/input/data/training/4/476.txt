By any means, "Jasc Paint Shop Pro 7.0" is a nice imaging tool. This continuity software showcased those genes, which enabled its earlier versions win numerous awards. Apart from being easy-to-deploy and use, it has excellent stability. Its enhanced features ensured that it is highly productive. Web-designers would appreciate the inclusion of JavaScript rollovers, and several other web-imaging tools in this '7.0 Pro' version.
However, versatile image-editors should note that this 'Paint Shop' does not have the advanced premium features, which are evident in both 'Adobe Photoshop' and 'Corel Photo-Paint' programs. Still, its value-for-money did exceed those of 'Photoshop' and 'Photo-Paint'.
