I've been an IBM compatible computer user for years and was a Micosoft BETA tester for Windows 95 so naturally have a lot of Windows software. I recently became a Mac owner and found that many of the Windows applications I have had no Mac counterpart. Parallels seemed to be the answer. Using Parallels to run Windows reminded me of the days when Windows was an operating environment loaded after booting into DOS and it always felt that way to me. I encountered a problem in trying to print from Windows applications which rendered those applications useless. Attempts to get technical support from Parallels or Mac were fruitless. Parallels was unresponsive and Mac wanted $100 just to answer a question on the telephone. I had also purchased several Mac applications which were similar to their Windows counterpart but not as usable. I abandoned my Mac and returned to using my IBM compatible (which is nowadays called a PC). PC stands for Personal Computer which a Mac is also.
