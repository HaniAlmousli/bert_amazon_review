There is so much that can be said about security software. It can be either a hit or a miss in regards to the best of what is done to protect your computer from any damage. But trying to find the right one can work to your advantage, while looking for the wrong one, can actually lead to the end of your computer. This security software from Avast specifically for your Mac computers, doesn't actually deliver for the money. Instead it does slow the speed and the quality of your Apple computer. I found this software to be very easy to install. However, it was very easy for spyware to slowly go into my computer. It honestly might seem like a good buy, but overall it definitely might be more of a heartbreak. I really found better antivirus programs to be worth the money like Norton and Bitdefender. Overall, I would recommend a software that really delivers more for the money, than something free, and can ruin a computer.
