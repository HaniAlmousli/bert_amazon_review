I really wanted to like this product. I've had it for months now because they claim that over time, Dragon will learn your profile and perform better. The real problem is I find the experience working with Dragon to be frustrating. I've tried to dictate stories in Word 2010, write e-mails, reply on message boards, respond on instant messengers and eve toyed around with navigating in Windows. Of those attempts, using Word has been the most successful but still not a great experience. It could be because the bulk of my writing is of the creative kind. I did use a gaming headset that's pretty good and noise reduction.

There are a lot of good points though. For one, I can have the TV going, voice chat on my notebook and still be able to use Dragon with my desktop headset with almost no problems because of the excessive noise. That's pretty cool actually. Dragon did pretty well with some unusual character names in some of my stories, and seemed to learn the other names after several frustrating attempts. Working in Word, there were a lot of better options for corrections, undoing lines and punctuation.

The not so good, I couldn't get Dragon to easily utilize smart quotes. I looked online, and it looks like there are a few creative ways around this problem, but really if my Word doc is set-up to use smart quotes, I just don't understand why it's such a struggle for Dragon to use them. They even updated Dragon with 11.5 that allows you to "quote" that, which a really, really nice feature for quoting and dealing with conversations.

Working on a message board wasn't as fun. Dragon seemed to have some trouble with undo, delete and other corrections in comparison to how well those features worked in Word. It was nice on one hand because basic message boards don't really offer an undo, for example, so the fact you can do an undo can be seen as a boon. The problem is, it doesn't seem start and end in appropriate segments like word did. Starting a new paragraph, deleting, doing another sentence and then another and saying undo seemed to wipe out everything.

Really Dragon is a fascinating tool. I know a version of it is going to be used in clinical areas where I work, but I personally found the experience more frustrating than anything else. On the other hand, I am a pretty quick typist, so it wasn't really for speed reasons I would want to use this so much as an easier way to get my thoughts down.

I think some people are going to love this product, and I would encourage anyone with patience and experience with this type of software to give it a go. For those of us who are kind of interested but not really trying to fulfill some sort of need, it might not be worth the hassle. It's still impressive though, and I experience no real technical issues with it at all, Win 7 64 OS.

I did not use Dragon to write this review.
