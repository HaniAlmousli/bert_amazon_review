This sort of software comes with a significant learning curve, but Corel's habit of including tutorials puts a dent in that difficulty.  This title comes with a lot of design art; borders, clipart, design elements, fonts, etc.  This is an excellent program for design layout and vector editing.  If you're new at this sort of software, work through the tutorials and you will be pretty amazed at what you can accomplish.

I particularly liked the option to modify each individual portion of the image.  For example, I tried painting a few Kanji (Japanese written language characters).  Each stroke was individually adjustable, so if I flubbed the proportions a bit, I could fix the parts rather than start over.  I also enjoy the option to work in separate layers for similar reasons.
