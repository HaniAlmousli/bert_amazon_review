For years, I have used Avast open source antivirus software for my Windows computers.  I'd say, Avast (free-of-charge version) is weaker/less intrusive than Kaspersky, while McAfee and Norton are stronger/more intrusive than Kaspersky.

What I want in antivirus software is to be a little safer while browsing the internet and avoid the hassle that a virus causes.  Antivirus software packages will tend to lump in extras, like being able to remotely force your phone to log out of everything in case it's stolen or whatever.  I don't want to deal with that, because I'm not going to figure out how to use those features, so they may as well not exist for me.  Kaspersky has the feature of being able to remotely wipe a smart phone.

The best feature of this particular package is that it can install on several different types of computers, phones, and tablets.  I have a Windows 8 netbook, a Windows 7 computer, and an Android phone.  I also wanted my husband to install this on his iPhone.  I like that for these devices, I only have one software package to deal with and keep up with, in case I want to reinstall or have to go back and find the purchase.  Sadly, I was not able to install this on my Android phone, because I have a really low speced off brand phone and did not have enough available memory for Kaspersky.  My phone is just awful, but I couldn't find minimum software requirements on Kaspersky's website, so that's why the low review.  If minimum specs were available, then it would be my fault for trying to do anything with the cheapest off plan Android I could find.  That aside, I'm glad to have antivirus on my computers.

Amazon has the price for this 5 device protection, as of when I'm writing the review, cheaper than if you buy it from Kaspersky's website.  So, if you want this, Amazon is a good place to get it.  But... if you want a really good deal, the 3 user license is today $80 on Kaspersky's website, but only $25 from Amazon.  So, the 3 user/device package has a much bigger discount.
