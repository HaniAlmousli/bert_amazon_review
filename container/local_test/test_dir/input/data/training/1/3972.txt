I was unable to get this to complete a whole DVD of content. I wasted almost an entire spool of DVD's. I have given up trying to get this to work. I will probably end up using a service like Stash Space. I have less than 10 tapes that are worthy of converting so it will be worth having a pro do it. I wanted this to work so bad!

I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.
Would I spend my own money on this? No
