As the title of this review states, a lot has changed in Windows since the XP/Vista days. It would seem Microsoft is only building the OS for tablets and touch devices however this design logic falls badly on a classic desktop or laptop. If you have a Windows 8 phone you'll probably be at home.. but if you fear or dislike change i'd wait this one out. To date I haven't seen any applications forcing Windows 8 for support (it'd be crazy if they did). I continued to use Windows 8 on a dedicated PC and installed on a Mac (via Bootcamp) with hopes i'd see some element of why Microsoft went in this direction and all i've come up with is the phone designers helped with this OS.

Now, the reason I gave this product 3 stars instead of 1 is because some elements of Windows 8 are useful. Those would include impressive performance improvements, full screen applications, advanced task manager for power users and anti-virus built in. Sadly though these improvements are greatly overshadowed by the design decisions made in Win 8.

Personally, i'd skip this one and continue with Win 7.
