Wow -- this is full of bells and whistles!!! And while the HELP function is very good, it is 800+ pages worth of..."Help", which can be a little confusing for this neophyte --- who is more used to Free-Download Adobe photo limited-function but easy to use editing software.

It was easy to install but I see that I have TWO versions of it showing on my screen and don't know if this is the norm - I have the Corel 32 bit and then the 64 bit (I have a 64 bit computer). Opening either one takes a looong time.

I have pre-ordered a tutorial book on Corel PaintShop Pro X7  , which I am sure will greatly assist my learning curve. What I do see of this while tooling around on the screen with it, is an extensive palette, and many options -- which surround the original photo to be edited on the screen. I know that once I get the hang of things, I will be like a kid in a candy shop.

Corel software has always had an in-your-face-here-I-am down to earth kind of presentation, so while it looks difficult, I can tell by the layout and the way the tools are paced, as we as the options presented on the screen, that this WILL be fun to work with once I get the hang of it.
