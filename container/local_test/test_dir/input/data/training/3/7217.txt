Or like me they will find themselves tolerating over time by ignoring it's most obnoxious features.

I've been running Windows 8 upgrade for the last couple of days and wanted to give my initial impressions of the latest Microsoft OS, as someone that's been using Windows forever i.e. Win 3.11;it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be and then again not as good as it could be.

First, I ran the compatibility checker of course and it said all hardware was compatible and only had a couple of software problems like it said I had to uninstall security essentials and wireshark not compatible. Not bad I thought. First impressions are important and the Windows 8 upgrade setup program didn't give a good first impression. It's more confusing that the older Win7 installer for experienced user. I couldn't tell if I could install on separate partition since the only options were erase everything or upgrade everything. And a WARNING if you plan on keeping Windows 7 around in case you are not sure if you want to stick with Windows 8 don't run the installer inside Windows because it will automatically upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 8! Later I figured out you can get the more familiar win 7 installer,if you boot directly from the DVD that is, where it lets you choose what partition to install on and let's you erase, create new partitions and do a clean install. Anyways, I did a dual boot install just to play it safe and keep Win7 around if needed. After finishing the install ,which didn't really seem much faster than Win7, and actually I thought it locked up at one point but it was hard to tell with the new plain square logo which doesn't even pulsate anymore like Win7 did when you booted.

After the upgrade completed, I found out that my wireless didn't work. That's right even though it said my wireless was compatible it didn't work and I just got yellow exclamation next to it. I was about to give up but I figured I just try the trick I did when Vista first came out which is use another wireless usb stick to connect to the Internet and see if windows could find any drivers for it and sure enough that worked,so much for an improvement over Win7 in that regard.

The first time you log into Windows 8 it plays a video showing you how to use Windows by moving your mouse to the edges. You know the GUI is unintuitive when they have to show a video just so you can figure out how to use the new OS GUI! If you don't want to waste time fumbling around trying to figure out where everything went and disappeared to learning the Win+X shortcut is essential! Actually, this is the first Windows version where I've actually used the keyboard more than my mouse since some things now take too many steps i.e. like shutting down or are near impossible to do. I got stuck a couple of times in some of the new metro apps took over my entire screen and I wasn't able to quit or get back to the desktop! Tip: if this happens to you just hit the Windows key on your keyboard. If you really can't stand the new GUI you can recreate everything just like in Win7 for the most part and stay in the classic desktop instead of the new metro start screen. I think the two things that are going to annoy most people is the lack of the Start button and inability to boot directly to the old classic desktop instead of Metro. I know it still bugs me!

All the programs and games I normally use in Windows 7 seem to work just fine in Windows 8. If it doesn't you can try right clicking to troubleshoot compatibility. My WEI score is the same in Win8 as it was in Win7 so seems no performance change according to that benchmark. Seems to be way more stable than Vista or even Win7 when it first came out. Gotten a lot fewer crashes than when Win7 first came out. My problematic wireless usb, which I mentioned isn't compatible, even though Windows 8 says it is has been causing the most problems even causing a BSOD!

Another thing I didn't like is that there was like a 200MB update as soon as I first logged in and unlike Win7, Win8 rudely rebooted my computer in the middle of a browsing session and didn't warn me or give me option to postpone the reboot. At least on Mac OS X there is option to restore all your windows and browser to the way you had them, even after a reboot. Some of the things I do like about it so far is that you can now read pdf files without having to install acrobat just like mac os has always been able to, and IE now comes with Flash already built in. It's always annoying having to install all those basic programs.

I really like the new task manager, it gives you a lot more info than before and Microsoft now has something that even mac os does which is very cool and needed by people nowadays with bandwidth caps, metered connections. If your right click your wireless it'll tell you how much bandwidth you have used. Now that I think about it a lot of the new stuff in Win8 seems like it's copied directly from OS X. For example, there are no games included now and Microsoft basically forces you to get minesweeper and solitare from the app store now! The icons on the metro screen are just like a cross between the widgets in OS X dashboard and launchpad. It's looks like they also copied the Xbox GUI and brought it into windows.

Smartscreen, which caught me off guard first time I tried installing something I downloaded from the Internet, is Microsoft's version of Gatekeeper which does the same thing on OS X. It get's very annoying if you don't have an Internet connection because it will appear that the installation program is frozen until it figures out you aren't connected! So that is one of the new security features they added to Win8. Secure boot is another one that is causing uproar in the Linux community since it causes headaches if you want to dual boot Windows and Linux.

Biggest disappointments, from a technical point of view, is that Win8 isn't 64bit only like we thought it would be a couple of years ago. Even Mac OS X is now fully 64-bit although that upset the people that couldn't upgrade their older Macs. Also, the Achilles heel of Windows, the registry, because it's too easy to corrupt and render Windows useless, is still there along with the winsxs problem. The WinSxs problem can grow out of hand and eat up all your disk space! I've been saying since XP ,why can't they include .net into windows instead of making you download it like Java? A couple of programs I tried to run said I needed the .net 2 or 3 mainly Steam games and so I had to download another 20-200MB file for that to work and you have to be connected to net to download it since there is no standalone version.

Another big letdown is that only the server version got the new filesystem ReFS, win8 only got storage spaces, which is more software raid. Microsoft has been promising a new improved filesystem several Windows versions back. I think the hardcore power users are going to have to accept the fact that the future of both Windows and Mac OS X is going to become and more geared to the iPod and Xbox crowd with their simplistic touch GUI and interface. This is also the group I'm guessing will have a more favorable view of the new GUI changes. I guess I'd probably be way more impressed if I had a touch capable PC since a lot of the new stuff seems to be geared towards that? I mean the command line is still there somewhere but it's hidden pretty good just like in OS X. Only thing I've really seen for geeks is something that macs and linux have been able to do for a long time already which is run the operating system from an external or usb stick, called windows to go but you need enterprise version for that.

As far as improvements in performance go, I haven't really seen any performance increases or disc space savings to warrant being in a rush to upgrade. My boot times are pretty much the same as with Win7 but then again I have an SSD drive , so Windows has already been pretty fast using that. In fact, the upgrade installer said I needed to free up at least 20GB of space min to even start the upgrade! Still no less than Win7 and XP only needs 10GB. Personally, I think I'll stick with Win8 it since I need to do a clean install on my SSD anyways since I have a whole bunch of old Windows 7 updates hogging up my SSD (the WinSXS problem I mentioned above) and haven't really had any major show stoppers so far like Vista or even Win7 when it first came out.

Finally, you need to get the media center upgrade, to play DVD's, otherwise you can't even play dvd's without installing powerdvd or some other program! I think this new version of Windows would be a lot more popular if it wasn't for Microsoft arbitrarily removing the start button so users are forced to use the new metro start screen whether you want to or not!

Finally they did add a new option to disk cleanup that few will notice that addresses the WinSXS issue:
This is a MAJOR improvement over Windows 7, but I bet they only did it for Windows 8 because of all the ranting about WinSxS.
This is a fantastic news for SSD users!

You can find Disk Cleanup by typing: WIN Key and start typing Disk Cleanup
Click the Disk Cleanup's "Clean up System Files" Button in the middle of the screen.
Check the box for Previous Windows Installation(s)
Click "OK" button and click the "Delete" Confirmation button.
Now, only if they included a registry cleaner!
and fixed the start button and booting into metro issues this would be a solid OS upgrade!
