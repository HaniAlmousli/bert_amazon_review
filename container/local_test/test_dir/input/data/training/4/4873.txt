There are a lot of powerful features in Serif PhotoPlus X4. That's good, but it can also be bad if you can't make them work. You have to enter your activation code the first time you run the program. Also, when you first run the program the "What do you want to do?" wizard is displayed. The wizard has a learning section which includes videos to demonstrate how a number of the features are used. The speakers have a British accent and can be a little hard to understand at times. You can't access any of the menus until you close the wizard. The initial display looks rather similar to Corel PaintShop Pro X2 / X3 if you're familiar with PaintShop.

There are some idiosyncrasies in Serif PhotoPlus X4. For example, if you choose the Save As command, the file types that you can choose from are only PhotoPlus' Spp format and the jpg format. If you want to save as another file format or if you want to use the optimizer to control picture size and quality, you have to use the Export command. Another example is the adjustments gallery on the right side of the workspace. This gallery shows a number of adjustments to choose from, like (color) levels, curves, color balance, brightness/contrast, hue/saturation, channel mixer, gradient map, lens filter, etc. However, once you select one of these options and make an adjustment, you probably won't be able to see how to return to the adjustments menu. The reason is that the back button to return to the adjustments gallery is hidden. You'll have to drag the bottom border of the adjustments box down so that the back button is displayed. I prefer the way that Google's Picasa gives you adjustment options on the Effects menu because you can see a small image to preview what the adjustment might look like before you choose it. That's not the case with the adjustments box where you have to first choose an option and then you see the effect. There is also a PhotoFix feature which is similar to the adjustments box. And PhotoPlus has a Filter Gallery which is similar to the Picasa Effects in that it does show an small image which gives a preview of what the filter does.

There are some powerful features in Serif PhotoPlus that you may like. The "cut out" feature for cutting objects out of a picture is excellent. The makeover feature is good for removing red eyes, whitening teeth, removing blemishes, etc. You can work with raw files. There are also macros available for the power user.

At times the program would not let me do the things that I thought should be easy to do. For example, I cut out two different images and I wanted to paste one as a new layer on the other, but the command to paste a new layer was grayed out. Another time I did an adjustment to a picture and then I wanted to use the Cut Out Studio, but the Cut Out Studio command was grayed out and I could not select it. Another time I opened a photo and the photo was not displayed. So it was frustrating at times.
