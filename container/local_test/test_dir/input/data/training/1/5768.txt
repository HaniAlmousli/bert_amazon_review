No matter what you have heard about this product it is still HORRIBLE! The main issues remain the same as always with McAfee: It makes your computer crash, slows down the system and does not really offer "Total Protection"
Couple of comments: I have a blazing fast Dell computer (Intel i7 processor, 8GB RAM and a 500GB 7200rpm hard drive) This machine was running great UNTIL I dared to install Total Protection 2012. Although the speed does not sink to the bottom it is very noticeable the lack of speed when McAfee is updating or scanning. So I decide to get rid of this program and I find that my system was infected with some bug that Total Protection did not protect against! So I had to remove the virus and it was not really a big deal using the right software. The nightmare was to remove McAfee!
Now everything is better, my computer is protected by Kasperki PURE and it is fast as ever while MaAfee is resting in my local landfill.
