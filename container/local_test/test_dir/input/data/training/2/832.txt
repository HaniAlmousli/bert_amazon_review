Yeah, the title for this review sounds like a law firm. Sadly, there's nothing particularly funny about Office 2004. I bought it primarily for Microsoft Word, and have been very frustrated with the program's tendency to crash almost every time I use it. Additionally, there are so many (ahem) "features" that the program has become very difficult to use. Whenever possible, I use Word 5.1, which seemed to hit the sweet spot of usefulness and stability. Word 2004 just isn't stable enough for me to trust major projects to.
