At first I was enthusiastic about Norton 360, Version 2. I installed it on computers with both Microsoft XP and Vista Home Premium operating systems.  I previously had Norton Internet Security installed on both, so I thought it was just an upgrade.  For this reason I gave the program 4 stars.  Now I'm not sure.

After two months the XP operating system ran without any problems either on Visa or XP.  But then the new computer running on Vista crashed.  I lost all my files and had to access the recovery portion of the hard drive to get the computer to boot.  Then I had to download all the security downloads.  I have only dial-up so this has taken many hours.  And I have to reinstall all the programs I use - and delete the junk programs that came with the HP computer.  What a mess, and what a lot of work. Even the backup disk, created with Norton 360 didn't work as I hoped.  I do have all the files on the disk, but they did not all reload after I fixed the crash.

Update 3/1/09:  Maybe the problem was with the operating system, Vista Home Premium; or maybe it was Norton 360.  And maybe the glitch was repaired with a later update I download.  Anyway, the problem hasn't manifested itself since I reinstalled everything. Furthermore, I must admit, the problem never did occur with the WinXP operating system.  Also, it should be noted that the program I'm using has been updated with a new version.

Update 6/7/09:  I have continued to use Norton 360, Ver. 2.0, for another three months with Vista and WinXP and have had no new problems. Actually, I have grown to like Norton 360 and now rely on it with confidence.  It has reported stopping over a hundred threats and has stopped me cold when I accidentally entered several attack sites.
