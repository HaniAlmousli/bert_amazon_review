Plus,  It is cheaper than Turbo Tax.

Minus,  It isn't worth as much as Turbo Tax.  Maybe if you have a very simple return it is worth the money;  but for my return (I sold some stock, and have one employer) it couldn't handle it.  After I filled every thing out, and e-filed,  I got an email the next day saying e-file wouldn't accept my tax return for an unknown reason, I had to manually check every single entry (I could have done that without a computer program).  After not finding any problems, I tried to efile again, and was told to print out and send by mail (I could have done that without a computer program too).  All-in-All, it wasted a day of my time, and was only useful for adding some of the numbers, (other numbers I had to add myself, since it didn't support one of the forms I needed, I had to down load the 500 page form from the IRS and do the calculations by hand).
