the software on its own is excellent gives you all sorts of information on different places how to get there etc. the little device that came with it I wasn't to crazy over it and found the text over speech stuff to be annoying and more of s distraction. the software that comes with it is very good though , I am familiar with it anyhow with my ms works program that I use . I like it alot better then map quest and it seems a bit more accurate and if you need a detour it gives you those options as well.easy to follow software not too complicated.it would work well with other gps devices as well ,I just didn't care too much for the one that came with it. doesn't look to durable either and easy to lose cause of it's size.
