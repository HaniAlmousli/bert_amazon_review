Kaspersky Lab is a Russian computer security company and ranks fourth in the market share for antivirus software. This software includes Safe Money.  That's an interesting program that allows the user to visit a site whose security credentials aren't yet established while at the same time allowing for a "sandboxed" transaction. It slows down my Windows 7 environment but that's the cost of running the two.
