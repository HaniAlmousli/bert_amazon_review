CorelCAD is 1/6th the price of AutoCAD. CorelCAD has some of the higher end professional options removed which are present in AutoCAD. Corel is marketing this to professionals who cannot afford AutoCAD such as start-up businesses in architecture or those who do mechanical drawing in 2D and 3D.

I thought this would be fun for my family to learn to use since my teenage son has been using SmartWorks with his FIRST Robotics team. This is more complicated to learn than I had assumed. This software is not a right fit for me but that does not mean that it is not a high quality product offered literally at a fraction of the price of AutoCAD.

Since this is a high quality product at a great price I rate it 5 stars out of 5 = I Love It. I applaud Corel for making a scaled down product for those who cannot afford to spend over $4K on software. This is similar to comparing Photoshop vs. Photoshop Elements.

I can't ding the product or the manufacturer due to my error in thinking it was right for us. It is over my head.
