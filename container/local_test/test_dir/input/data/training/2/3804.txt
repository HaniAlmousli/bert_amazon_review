Not very pleased with this product, bought it to upgrade my older 2005 version & it is actually not as good as the old program. Push pins did not import properly & graphics are not a sharp as older version. Also errors in the new program are the same as in the old program.

For me it was a complete waste of money doing the upgrade. That said a newbie to the program might have a different feeling then I do and may like the program not knowing how the older version performed.

That is why I rated it as a 2 instead of a 1.
