Navigon has left the GPS hardware business, and so far it looks like they will not be releasing maps for FreshMaps on the schedule they promised, if at all. You will also have no technical support, and many people who purchased FreshMaps and attempted to register their purchase after Navigon shut down their GPS business have not been able to do so. I highly recommend you do not purchase this product.
