I cannot even express my outrage and disgust over the two "apologies" I have received from Intuit over the downgrade of their TurboTax product, and their offer of $25 to "make it right." Apparently the Tylenol Effect has worn off, and this is the sort of corporate mumblemumble that passes for responsibility.

******************************

Like so many other longtime TurboTax users, I reviewed my 2013 return to double-check the schedules I'd need.  Sure enough, I needed to move up two levels from my trusted TT Deluxe to TT Personal & Small Business to prepare my 2014 taxes using the same tax events as in years past. I'm deeply concerned that some aspect of this new return will be critically inconsistent with years prior, and trigger an audit. At this point I'm ready to forgo Amazon's 10% bonus, and turn to H&R Block software simply for a fresh start and some peace of mind.

I was talking with a friend who is a CPA, and apparently the Intuit dissatisfaction extends across all levels of their product line; TurboTax, QuickBooks, Quicken for Mac, on and on. She has had a wretched time preparing W-2's and other tax documents for her clients this year, all due to changes with Intuit's software for TY 2014. This is a company that has built a strong customer base over decades; I know, my family was involved from almost day one. This is as disgraceful as it gets, treating customers as dupes in a game of bait and switch which many will not realize until too late.
