I've used&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/H-R-Block-Deluxe/dp/B00G0DXA9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">H&R Block Deluxe</a>&nbsp;for the last 9 years, but this year I tried Turbo-Tax because I got a deal on it through Vanguard.

H&R Block has always been my choice because:

 - It's a great value ($20-$25 for Deluxe Fed + State if you set a price alert and wait a few weeks).
 - Good enough for my moderately complex returns.
 - Some annoying flaws, but no deal breakers.

Now I think Turbo-Tax is worth the extra $25 for many people.

 - The interface is significantly cleaner and easier.
 - Guidance is worded with extreme clarity. Less head scratching. Less second-guessing.

If you're preparing multiple returns, or even one return with some curve balls, you might appreciate Turbo-Tax's clearer, friendlier interface.
