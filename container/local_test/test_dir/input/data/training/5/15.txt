I am not an avid Lightroom user, although I have used it many times.  I have always wanted to dive into the tools and techniques of the software more and this video series has definitely put me on the right track.  The series does an excellent job of not only giving you a general tour and reference to what is available in Lightroom, but also diving into more important aspects that you do not pick up on out of the gate.

Watching the entire video in one sitting is probably not feasible since it's ten hours of content.  In fact, finding the time to watch the entire ten hours at all might be difficult.  Don't be fooled though as any time you invest in going through this video will improve your usage of Lightroom.  It really depends on what you want out of Lightroom.  If you are just wanting some simple organization and editing you won't need this video or certainly won't need all of it.  If you would like to dive into the publishing aspects and really optimizing your workflow, then this would be a good investment for you.
