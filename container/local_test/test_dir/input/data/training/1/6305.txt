Replacing the hard drive in my Mac forced me to repurchase the software.

I completely followed Apple's instructions on how to to copy my hard drive, (easy). (The Hard drive was purchased on Amazon.) Microsoft somehow detects this, and prevents the software from running on the new hard drive. I tried contacting Microsoft by telephone, the robot hung up on me. I was never able to speak to a human.

ALL other non-Microsoft software is operating perfectly with the new hard drive and required no additional money or effort on my part.

No complaints about the software itself, but clearly Microsoft is becoming more consumer hostile.
