The user interface of this product isn't bad, fairly intuitive and user friendly, but I was surprised to discover that features that I thought should be standard (at least standard for something for this price and with 'premium' in the name) had to have another pricey subscription to be activated. Doesn't make sense. There are cheaper products out there with more functionality.
