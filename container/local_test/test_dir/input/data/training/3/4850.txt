This works ok for me, it is nice to see how well my words are captured by Dragon software.  But, the thing is, right now this is like a shiny toy to me.  Fun, but not smooth enough that the commands are intuitive and/or the available command set in whatever application I'm in just pops at me (I know, there's a command browser, but that has a 90's feel to it).

If I had a driving need for Dragon and I just HAD to use it, then I'd be willing to dig in and go through the learning curve and take the time to learn the commands and train it to my voice ... at that point, all indications are that it could indeed be very powerful.

However, for the 'home' audience that this product is, I think a much slicker user interface is needed... better graphics, more intuitive such that it knows that I'm trying 20 different ways to say "open blah blah" and Dragon provides suggestions.  The user interface just doesn't have that dazzle that some of the newer applications are spending the time to create.
