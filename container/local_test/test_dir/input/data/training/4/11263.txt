I can't say I love Norton anti virus, BUT...
It seems to work much better than McAfee.
And I purchased it on sale with free prime shipping much, MUCH
cheaper than locally.
With McAfee and had one problem after another.
I Removed and reinstalled it 3 times and after the 3rd time I removed it.
I started using Norton and In the last 6 months I have only had
a slow start problem with the Norton 2 times.
I just purchased this one instead of the Renewal price.
So after 6 months, so far so good.
