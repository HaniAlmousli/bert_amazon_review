I am very satisfied with the purchase of this wireless router.
The setup took just a few minutes to complete the setup wizard and after that everything worked from the first time, perfectly.
I have now wireless connectivity throughout the whole house. The connection is stable and the speed is as advertised.
I considered Linksys and Netgear routers, but there always was some kind of problem with them.
I have not found any complaints with this 3Com router. Also my personal experience with 3Com products was another factor for my decision to by this product.
Bottom line - if you are looking for reliable, easy to use router this product is for you.
