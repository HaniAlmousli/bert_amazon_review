If you've spent much time on PCs this past decade, no doubt you recognize the familiar 4-color AVG logo from their wildly popular AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition. The free edition has been downloaded at C-Net's download.com an incredible 356 million times.

This is their full-featured suite, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/AVG-Internet-Security-3-User-2011/dp/B003WT1KFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AVG Internet Security 3-User 2011</a>. It's a breeze to set up, and just as easy to use.  Most all the features are configured for you right out of the box, and the features operate in the background, even the updates.  But there is a serious Achilles' heel for AVG. I'm always sensitive to resource usage of programs, especially multi-tasking programs like this one, and that's is where the AVG Suite falls behind.  Ten separate AVG processes are running in Task Manager, and the system speed slowed considerably.  I've tested Bit Defender Total Security 2011 and I use Norton 360 at work, but not even a noted resource-hog like Norton drags down performance like this. There were noticeable lags in bootup and operation, even on an advanced system such as mine, 2.66 ghz Quad-Core with 4 gb memory.  If you're system is equal or less powerful, I'd recommend against this product.

Two stars for ease of setup and use.
