Ordered this got information to get it  downloaded from Norton.  After several attempts the download did not work and kept taking me to an old account I had.  I had a person "Chris C" come on line Chat and send me instructions and ask if any questions while I was typing the person terminated the chat and not to be heard from since.  About the 7th attempt I got an error message MK4647B and to call 844-383-8998, a person  called who did not speak English very well I told him so and he  told me "That's your problem."  I did make out that he wanted control of my computer - no way I told him he hung up.  Now someone who can't speak English want's control of my computer, I get at least 1 call like that a day!  The guy called back and rudely made some comments, I hung up on him.  Now I got no software and Amazon says no refunds in their add for software.
Amazon has indicated that I will get credit for the purchase, but still will never buy Norton due to their customer service.
