It took me a very long time to configure this program and even now I have problems. As with any speech recognition software, you need to 'teach' it to recognize your own speech patterns. I'm still fighting with it even after a month of constant use. I constantly have to check if it interpreted my commands correctly and end up doing about 50% of the work via mouse and keyboard. The rest of the configuration is little better.
