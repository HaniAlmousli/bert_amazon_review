The only good part of this software is that it transferred the information from last year correctly. Many of the prompts and explanations are incomplete at best, confusing and misleading at worst. Kept dropping my entry for insurance deduction. Miscalculated the health insurance deduction. Would not print the form to attach for signature required by the IRS without a lot of messing around (had a "Print" button but it didn't do anything). Could not trust the outcome without manually reviewing every form/calculation. I could have entered the data on paper and mailed it quicker than using TurboTax Business 2010. Also, it automatically popped up an Internet Explorer window to review the software (which I did, of course) but when the final submission screen came up for the review it said it was for tax year 2009, not 2010. WAY TO GO Intuit!
