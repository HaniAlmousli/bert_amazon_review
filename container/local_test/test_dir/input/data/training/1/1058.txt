After several days of experimenting with iMovie 08 (part of iLife 08), I have found that I cannot use it. I have gone back to iMovie 06. With no ability to set Chapters where desired (without using Garageband!) no timeline editing and no sharing with iDVD I found the program unusable.

iMovie Lite 1.0 (iMovie 08) is fine to edit a 3 minute video to share on youtube, but it lacks features that are needed for longer projects or if you want to make a DVD of your movie.

iMovie Lite 1.0 (iMovie 08) lacks a true timeline, Nor does iMovie Lite 1.0 (iMovie 08) let you add DVD chapter markers to specific spots in a movie, such as the beginning of each major scene (each day in your vacation, for example).

I feel bad for people who purchase iMovie 08 but have never used 06. They may never know how good Apple can be at designing entry level video software.

But what if you want those missing capabilities? Apple has a great video-editing program for you: it's called iMovie HD (iMovie 06).

I am confident that Apple will eventually correct this mistake. (I understand that Apple has made iMovie 06 a free download for owners of iMovie 08!) I believe that the best course of action would be for Apple to continue upgrading iMovie 06 (iMovie HD) with full support for iDVD and DVD burning. Rename iMovie 08 (iVideo?) for small, quick little videos or slideshows for absolute beginners that don't want to burn a DVD.
