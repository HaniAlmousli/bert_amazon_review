I know there are fans of this software, and it's a good buy, but I prefer Photoshop Elements (Adobe) and can't get into the PS Pro interface. It's ok but I find it slower and clunkier than Photoshop Elements. I suppose it's what you are used to, that is, a matter of taste. However, it will do the job of editing photos. Meh.
