I finally ended up uninstalling this on my main PC. Most of my systems have Windows 10 on them, and even though it is supposed to be compatible, it didn't work. In addition, it took a lot of resources to work. It doesn't help that W10 takes up a lot of resources already.

I'm an Adobe user. If you are familiar with the product then you know it's not the easiest to use.  So I use Corel VS7 for those faster projects. I was hoping to use this one for when my grand daughter wants to make home movies.  I have a laptop with Windows 8.1 on it. I will try that one
