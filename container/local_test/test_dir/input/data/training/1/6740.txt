I am a 20 year user of Quicken.  Generally I have been satisfied with it until this year.  I am a Mac owner and have installed Parallels and Windows just so I could run Quicken.

I even was a beta tester for their Mac product.  I was disturbed when as a tester that Quicken ignored the majority of the other beta testers who were asking them to basically port the Windows version and features to the Mac version.

Now with 2013 they have decided to eliminate a simple way they had been using to enter, track and pay loans.  Instead they have created an obscure, complicated, not user friendly process (Not a simple window with your needed options like "pay" and "when" and "make extra payment" and check balances.)

Other users have complained about this and several have said they will drop the program after many years if Quicken does not change it to the simple process it was before.

I will wait a month and if it is not fixed, I will look for a better finance program.
