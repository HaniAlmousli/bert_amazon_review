By now we've all heard about the horrors of Windows 8 and I'd have never bought it.  But... I got a chance at a free copy so I jumped on it.  It took a while for me to warm to Windows 7, I thought maybe the same would apply to Windows 8.

I first played with Win8 on a Microsoft Surface tablet PC.  It seemed like Windows reworked for a tablet form factor.  OK, that makes sense. Mostly though, I found it annoying because I couldn't find things.  Nothing was where it was supposed to be.  Configuring and setting up was a pain.

I loaded this version onto a small desktop and tried to use it.  It loaded easily and runs fine, I guess.  The problem is that I don't like to use that computer.  I know where things are in Win7.  I have a working relationship with Win7.  Why oh why did Microsoft decide that I needed to learn yet another way to get things done?  Why did MS decide my old work patterns should change?

I'm hoping that Win8 grows on me.  Maybe it will.  he problem is that I don't -need- to shift to Win8.  Five years ago, I had to stick with whatever Microsoft did.  Now I think I have options.  For example, I'm currently writing this review on a chrome book using google docs.  Years ago I'd have fired up MS word.

Anyways, I'm going to try using Win8 on that computer and I might get to liking it.  Someday, but certainly not now.  I'm sure Win8 is wonderful for someone's first computer, but I'm all trained up on previous  versions.  Using and learning Win8, to me, reduces my productivity.
