I'll just add another voice to the chorus here saying that this product is a disappointment. It's confusing to use, particularly if you want to actually use it for its intended purpose... what good is backing up if you can't figure out how to restore from a backup?

I hoped Acronis would see all these reviews and make improvements, but I see that the new version has poor feedback as well. There are many products out there to choose from, and there's no need to use one that's as unstable and unintuitive as this one.

The second star is only because I read another reviewer used and loved the disc clone feature, which I haven't tried/needed. At least someone's butt got saved.
