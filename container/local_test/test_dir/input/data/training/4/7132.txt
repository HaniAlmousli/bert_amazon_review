Microsoft Office Professional 2013 is nicely redesigned, fully integrated with cloud, and very touch-screen friendly, but at a substantial cost especially for individual users.  Users of Office 2010 can also access cloud through free third-party services.  So, the major improvement is not cloud access, but the newly incorporated finger gesture recognition now available to every touch-screen equipped device, like tablets, and allowing to scroll, zoom, pan, ribbon-hiding, enlarging and spacing apart icons, etc.  The suite is available as both, a boxed copy, as well as - for the 1st time - on the basis of annual subscription.  Some new features are still buggy (nothing new for Microsoft), but they should be patched, as usually, sooner or later.  Still, the best suite around.
