I've been using Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 and I am not too enthusiastic about it. It does have some added value over online mapping solutions. However, it also has a lot of issues and in the end it is not a product I would pay for.

It is easier to create detailed multi stop routes using Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 than using online mapping solutions. I especially like the "Find Nearby Places" feature. The Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 application also has a lot more options and settings and it is easier to personalize. It is nice that you can work off-line and save your plans as a document, reload the file, update the route, save again, etc.

You are also supposed to be able to download your routes to your GPS device. This would be a nice feature if it worked. However, I have never gotten this to work. I have no problem downloading maps and other features to my GPS devices from, for example, the Garmin web site and other sites. However, I get "device not detected" no matter which Garmin GPS I use, and no matter which USB port I use, and no matter which computer I use, despite the fact that all USB ports work and my Garmin devices have no problem communicating with other sites.

The Help does not contain anything helpful, and none of the on-line information I found was helpful. I tried a number of things that did not work. Microsoft thinks it is the vendor who should inform you whether the GPS device is compatible with Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 and the vendor nearly dies laughing when he hears that. Basically, customer support does not exist and you won't get any help, and it simply does not work. Well, I know that some lucky people get this to work but from reading forums I know this is a common unresolved issue.

Anyway, other things I do not like is that Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 is notorious for freezing up and the route path on the map is way too thick and ugly and I did not find a setting to change it. I also don't think the maps look that nice. Between the online mapping solutions (Google maps, MapQuest, Bing, etc) and my GPS devices Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 adds very little value and with the issues I don't think this product is worth its price. That's my two cents.
