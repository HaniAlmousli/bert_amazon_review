I have been using Trend Micro on my main computer for around four years now, and my wife has as well. Our experiences have been mixed. While it does really well at nixing cookies (which is true for this as well), it sometimes doesn't do so well at other viruses, though. In our experiences, we have had good results by scanning, defragmenting the drive, and then scanning again. Repetition of this pattern for some time got rid of one pernicious virus that we had, but I have caught something on my computer that this product hasn't caught, yet.

As far as this particular program, we have been running it for about a week and a half. So far, it seems to perform about as does the more mainstream version. There are a wealth of more complex options, all of which seem to be designed to, essentially, protect you from yourself. If you are careless enough to need these, odds are good that you didn't bother to turn them on. Basic virus protection is good, and this product will probably suit most people's needs. Unless you visit a lot of warez sites and spend too much time downloading torrents, you probably won't get a virus that this can't handle. And, if you do, computers have a half life of something like a year and a half before replacement, so you probably shouldn't worry too much about that.

A major plus was the install. We installed this on a netbook that has no digital media reader (i.e., no CD/DVD ROM drive.) By using the website, we bypassed this need. The key on the CD worked with the online download, which was both nice and surprising.

Overall, its a good program. It does what it is supposed to do. If you buy it, you probably won't be disappointed. If you don't, there are a few comparable products, including McAfee's software. Either of these are good, take your pick.
