I already have Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac, but wanted some of the features that are in the Mac preferred office software (mainly Keynote).  This was a cheap way of getting all three of the office products that work really well on my machine.  The software installs quickly and if you are using the disk does not require a product key or serial number.  After installing Software Updates updated it to 9.3 (the last version before the switch to the 2013 version - what is currently in the App Store).  The software works fine (I am using Mountain Lion (I have not tried it in Maverick, but I am pretty sure it will not have an issue) - this is because Maverick did not work properly with some of my hardware, so I downgraded back to 10.8.5).  iWork as a software is great since it quickly launches and never freezes up like MS Office does.  However, it is a much different interface and will take some time to get use to.  I also do not like that you cannot default to save as a MS document, you can only export to those formats.  However, you can open and edit them all without any issues.

A feature I use frequently that is not available is equation editor, however, MS Office has it, so I use it in WORD.  Numbers and Pages work really well and offer a full feature of productivity software you expect with a Mac feel to it (so get ready to rely heavily on the File Menu vs the bar and banner like in Office).  Keynote is the main winner here, it offers some really nice features and transitions that make Presentations easy.  However, transitions are not as great as Office 2013, but for Mac options they are the best choice!

In the end this software is great and easy to use, I think if you are a real power user you will probably want both (MS Office and iWork), but for most users iWork will have that Mac feel and work really well.  I got this online since it was much cheaper than buying through the App Store (not the newest version, after the 9.3 update, it is close), but I do not see too many features that would constitute the App Store price).

I want to add that I purchased an NEW copy (from a third party seller), and I received just a disk in a sleeve.  The disk was a legit Apple disk (not a burn or anything), but it was not in a box.  This does not seem to matter since the disk worked perfectly, but I wanted to let you know, since based on the item I expected a In-Box Retail Version Software Product (I bought it NEW).
