The ONLY reason I purchased this is because Quicken ceases supporting their 2011 version.  there are no significant changes in this program that are readily apparent to the user.  The "upgrade" was simply a scam to extort money from folks who are committed to using this program for banking.

I would switch to another program in a heartbeat if there was was a competitor out there that wasn't horrible.

The program does what Quicken does as well as it ever did.  No real changes to functionality or interface.
