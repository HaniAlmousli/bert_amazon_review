My 12-year-old daughter is a good sketcher (trained from weekend art class). She loves drawing and sharing her drawings. When I saw that Anime Studio Pro 8 had the ability to take sketches made on paper and turn them into easy-to-manipulate animations, I knew that would be a great Christmas gift.

I am a complete new to computer animation. I was worrying that it might be difficult or very time consuming in getting started. Fortunately, SmithMicro provides a great getting-started tutorial that quickly introduced me to most of its main features. After about an hour with the tutorial, I am able to scan in and animate one of my daughter's sketches.

Thanks to the tutorial's section on using a "bone layer" to manipulate a sketch. It only take me about 15 minutes from (1) scanning a drawing, (2) adding some bones, (3) manipulating those bones along a timeline, and (4) finally exporting the animation to a Quicktime file (other export options are also available). I showed my daughter, and now she wants to learn to do some of this on her own!

I've only scratched the surface of what this software can do. SmithMicro's website has many tutorials available (some are online videos). I will dig deeper into the software's features when I have the chance. But for now, just being able to turn my daughter's cartoon sketches into actual animations is enough to keep her busy.

Overall, I am satisfied with this software.
