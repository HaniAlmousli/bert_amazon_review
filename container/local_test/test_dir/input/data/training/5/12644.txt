This is a tried and tested product of Peachtree - now renamed as Sage. I love the fact that it has easy installation and the ever so helpful wizards that in within the product. Not only that, they also have provide a contact service to call in case we need further assistance with the product.

This software can capture the snapshot of a company and present it in a easy to read and see form such as charts and graphs. I can look at it and tell what is the revenue the company is making, the vendors information - billing and collection etc. The best part, I can modify it to suit my needs and see which information needs my attention the most at the current moment. It even comes with Analysis tools which is useful for projections of the company in the short-mid term assessments.

It is so comprehensive that it can even do payroll and has the ability to allow for posting without closing the current Financial Year.

Great product for a small-medium sized company as it is not bulky like customized software such as SAP.
