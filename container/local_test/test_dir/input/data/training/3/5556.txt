A reasonably-priced 2D animation toolset for the hobbyist. It will give you a good introduction to animation without spending a fortune on a pro-level program. You can decide if you like the results before committing to buy the pro tools. Once you have registered the software, you have the opportunity to get updates AND free add-ons. (There are paid add-ons available too.) These add-ons give you pre-designed figures to work with, or add backgrounds to your library. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of view) version 8 has already been made obsolete by the availability of version 9. Since version 9 is considered an upgrade and not an update, you cannot get version 9 as a free download if you own 8. For the money this is a great program and it will give you a real feel for animating your artwork, or that of others.
