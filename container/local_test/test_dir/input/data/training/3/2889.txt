I'm not exactly sure why Microsoft sells this product on it's own. I prefer to buy the entire Microsoft Office bundle; outlook is the office program I use least (except for email). Like others, I find this version of Outlook to be a bit slow. Sometimes I have to wait 20-30 seconds for my email, over an extremely fast internet connection.

However some of the new features are very good, such as exchange server and sharepoint 3.0. At work, sharepoint is used effectively to connect our large work team (consisting of over 150 employees) by posting events, information, honors, and opinions. Another great feature is the ability to share your calender schedule through emails. Another good new feature is the auto-assitant feature, which allows you to send an automated message to people trying to email you when you're out. This feature was available in the previous edition, but now you can program the assistant to come on automatically at certain times (in case you forget to turn it on).

Graphically the layout of Outlook is better in this version, Unfortunately most users won't notice these new features right away, because they are not as obvious as Outlooks pretty new layout.
