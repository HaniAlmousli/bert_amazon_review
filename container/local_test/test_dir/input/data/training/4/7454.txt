I've seen many negative reviews for the 2013 version and don't understand. Some are awfully suspicious and most are complaining about having to pay for extra features rather than the product itself. Some people want more for nothing... The 2014 edition is hitting the spot though.

This is the best accounting software I've tried. Whether you run a small business or something very tiny out of your home, Sage is worth it.

Pros:
-Easy to set up, use, and learn. Obviously learning comes easier if you have an accounting or reporting background.
-Runs smoothly and without error after a few weeks of use.
-Sage has upgraded! Lots of features and the interface looks good.
-The software helps you determine which tools are most beneficial for your needs.
-Good for forecasting and managing inventory.
