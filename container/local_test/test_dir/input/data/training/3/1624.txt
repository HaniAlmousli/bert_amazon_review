HELP, PLEASE!!! AMAZON PRODUCT REVIEWS ARE VERY HELPFUL TO ME, ESPECIALLY WITH PROBLEMATIC PRODUCTS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ME OR MY PCs.****SEE QUESTIONS AT BOTTOM.**** I have given NIS a middle or neutral rating because NIS 2007 was so bad, but NIS 2008 appears to be much better.  I just do not know enough about NIS 2008.

I purchased Norton Internet Sececurity 2007 shortly after it was released in August or September 2006.  I installed it on 3 of our computers with Windows XP (Professional and Home) operating systems. Although I had had great experience for more than 10 years with Norton products, NIS 2007 was so bad that I vowed never to use or buy any Symantic product.  NIS 2007's initial loading required that I delete my spyware  software protection programs in order to install NIS 2007 (to sell Norton???), it slowed all 3 PCs to a snail's pace, it had unneccessary functions, I could not delete or turn-off those functions without a waring, ad nauseum.

HOWEVER, I downloaded Trialware of NIS 2008 on a laptop with VISTA.  NIS 2008 was less disruptive to install and it works so well that I am considering istalling it on our other PCs, but I would like some more input from users of NIS 2008.
  1.  WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH NIS 2008 ON PCs WITH WINDOWS XP?
  2.  ON XP, DOES NIS 2008 WORK BETTER THAN NIS 2007?
  3.  WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH NIS 2008 ON PCs WITH WINDOWS VISTA?
  4.  ON VISTA, DOES NIS 2008 WORK BETTER THAN NIS 2007?
