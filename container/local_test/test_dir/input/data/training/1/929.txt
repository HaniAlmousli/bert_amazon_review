The first time I installed this product on reboot the computer entered safe mode.  The second installation the computer entered chkdsk and replaced alot of files.  At the desktop the product wanted to reinstall itself.  I declined.  I have had computers for 25 years now, never had software act so alien to a computer.  I purchased it from Bestbuy, they declined a refund because the package was open.  Check refund policy before buying this product.
