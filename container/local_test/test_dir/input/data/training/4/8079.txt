When I started typing, we had manual typewriters (clickity clack and ting for the return). Electric typewriters were available but not at our high school. By the time I went to college, I had an electric typewriter and actually charged $1 per page to type papers for fellow students. Although at that time, it was not particularly lucrative, it was the practice that became invaluable to me.

As a business owner now, I can't tell you how much time I save in having good typing skills. I try to tell my kids that they will never regret being a good typist. They still don't get it but hopefully... So the point is, to be a good typist, you have to practice and you have to practice by using good technique as well or breaking the bad habits will be almost impossible. For example, although I can type at about 70 words per minute, I still only use one of the shift keys no matter what hand I need the capital letter. Oh well.

What this all means is that you need to have a way to practice in a methodical manner. Mavis Beacon does a good job of going through the keys in the method and order I remember back in high school. There are plenty of ways to practice and then test yourself as well. Each person has a profile to keep track of your own progress. The lessons can also be read out loud and there are instructional videos as well. It is a little hokey at times but it gets the point across. It is not super fun so that kids have games and things to play if they are trying it but I actually think it is perfect for young teens or adults learning to type for the first time. Or, if you want to hone your skills. It is frustrating that you cannot backspace to correct when typing but I believe that is how the high school tests are done as well, and that is the best way of calculating your ability to type error free.

My kids (one has done it and one will be in a few years) have to pass a typing test in high school as part of the curriculum. This is a great way to get them to be more prepared.
