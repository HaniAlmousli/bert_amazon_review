After faithfully backing up my hard disc to recovery points for almost a year I tried to do a system restore last night.  The first time failed and said that the registry entries had been corrupted.  The 2nd time I went to a restore point earilier and there were still corrupted registry entries, but it worked better.  Now certain programs won't launch, those that do seem slower.  I'm not certain that reinstalling the software that won't launch will be sufficeint to solve the problem.

I don't reccommend this software.  Fortunately I had backed up my data files to an external hard drive, so if I have to reinstall Windows I've not lost my irreplacable photos.  What I ahve lost is hours and hours of time, time that I would have perfered using to create my digital art instead.
