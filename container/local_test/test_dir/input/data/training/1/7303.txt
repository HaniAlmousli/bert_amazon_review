Customers should be very careful with this product.  It has some very handy features but they come bundled with some nasty surprises.

I consider myself to be a long-standing highly-experienced computer user.  I starting building home-brew computers in the mid 70s.  However, I did not anticipate that this version of Norton Utilities would wreak such damage to my computer settings.

Of course, many cookies are intrusive and dangerous and should be deleted.  But many cookies are extremely valuable -- on a secure home computer.  This version of Norton Utilities deleted every cookie (good, bad, and in between) without ever asking whether I might want to keep any.  In addition, it added an extension to my browser that slowed it to a crawl.  The resulting page would have no formatting.  If I refreshed the page the formatting would appear.  Also, my Quicken passwords have suddenly disappeared.

I have taught thousands of university-level computer science students.  I am embarrassed at the number of my C students who have graduated and are now producing commercial software.  However, this version of Norton would not get a passing grade.
