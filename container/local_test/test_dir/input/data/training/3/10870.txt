Although I prefer to install from a disk, this product installed without issue. the promised protection is comprehensive though at this point it is hard to gauge just how efficient it is. I do think it slows down the computer. I installed on a desktop that had a free version of avira. This program is a tad more intuitive when it comes to scheduling scans but there has been a marked decrease in speed and responsiveness. I will probably uninstall this since the slowness is really annoying. So it is okay if you don't have a need for speed.
