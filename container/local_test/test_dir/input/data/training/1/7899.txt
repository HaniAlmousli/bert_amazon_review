What would you think if you bought a new car and immediately had over a hundred updates to make it run properly?  Buy Windows 8.1 and you will enjoy several hours of upgrades.  Other features include the system freezing when you run disk clean up.  The system freezing on shutdown.  The new GUI is so difficult to use with all the APP format that you swear you will never buy a PC again.  Windows 8.1 is the best marketing campaign to boost Mac sales.  I am computer literate and find this design counter intuitive.  Others I know feel the same way about Windows 8.1.  There is a free product on the market that allows you to reconfigure Windows 8 back to the previous styles.  The product is called Windows Classic Shell and it lets you choose the GUI format you want to work with, XP, Windows 7....  This is easy to install and does leave some Windows 8 functionality.  You can also easily switch to Windows 8 GUI if so desired.  Bottom line - buy a Mac, their software is intuitive, professionally designed and built.  Best of all, it doesn't freeze up all the time.
