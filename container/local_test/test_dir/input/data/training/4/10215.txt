I've been using one version or another of Acronis now for nearly a decade.  It's saved my rear end numerous times so I always make it a point to buy a copy of the current one when I get a new PC.

The only thing I use the software for is to make a basic image of my PC as a recovery image if I need to restore the system and as a weekly scheduled backup of the system partition to allow me to backtrack to the previous week if something goes wrong.  In that, the software does a great job.  I like the Secure Zone concept, which creates a partition that's hard to mess with and lets Acronis use that to make backups.  Not impossible for a virus to take it out, but definitely harder and far less likely you'll delete one by mistake.

It's not without it's problems, like the interface this time around is just awful in my opinion.  It probably has some more features I may like, but it's daunting for me to dig through to find them so I may never have time to bother.  There are other imaging tools out there, but I'm comfortable with Acronis so I stick with them.  I haven't found better yet.  I'm sure some have, but so far in all the time using this or any of the past versions, I've never hit a glitch where I couldn't recover.  I'm happy with the software, even if I liked the old interface better.
