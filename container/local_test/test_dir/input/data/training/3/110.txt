I wanted an easy way to learn spanish so that I could talk to my neighbors and some co-workers who prefer to speak spanish, but there wasn't any way I could afford the Rosetta Stone pricetag. And even though (from what everyone says) the dialect seems to be mainland Spain, I just want to pick up enough to carry on some useful conversations. I have learned a lot of vocabulary, and being around people who speak the language the speed of the use on some discs is not uncomfortable. I'm not crazy about the flashcard games, but then I don't like flashcrad games of any kind. For the most part I am enjoying using this system, and my friends who speak the language seem to appreciate the effort and have been helpful and patient with me.

Naturally, a class would be better, and if I needed this for real in the business world that would be how I would go. For my purposes it's working out ok so far. I'm considering the Italian version, but first I want to get this down a bit better.
