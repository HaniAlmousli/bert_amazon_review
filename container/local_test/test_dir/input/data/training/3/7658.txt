It is unconscionable that Intuit makes their software obsolete every three years.  They are clearly milking their customer base because, unfortunately, Quicken is the only game in town - assuming you don't want to put your financial life into someone's hands on the web.  If I had other options for a stand-alone personal finance manager, I would jump at the opportunity to drop Quicken H&B. or any other version of software that is a part of the Quicken product line.  Don't buy Quicken if you can avoid it - or - accept the fact that you'll be buying a new version every three years or living with a deliberately crippled version of the software.
