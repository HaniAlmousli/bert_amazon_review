Kaspersky has been a great internet security suite, compared to others it is low on overhead, efficient and effective.  I have been using KIS since 2009 and I have had no complaints.  I find this version a little more streamlined and efficient than the 2011 version that hangs every so often when you click on the desktop widget to access the program dashboard.

KIS continues to be very easy to install and use.  Unlike others, it does not require lots of training and setup to provide good protection.  I was skeptical about this early on, but I have not had any problems yet.  Having the 3 license pack makes it easy for me to have a hands-off version that I can install on my parent's machine while also having good protection on my machine.

The one thing that continues to bug me is that the update takes FOREVER even if the update is only several hundred Kb.  And while it does this, on my older computers it does seem to make them lag a bit.  If they would fix that, I would give it 5 stars
