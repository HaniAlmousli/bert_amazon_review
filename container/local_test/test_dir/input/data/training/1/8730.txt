I bought this to install on my 2 computers. Neither computer would accept and install. I called WEBROOT support. I was informed that my Internet network connection was not secured and that it would cost me hundreds of dollars for them to fix. I would then be able to install this software. I said no thank you and called my ISP, ATT. They told me that my Internet network connection was indeed secure. I've since installed Microsoft Security Essentials. The cost: $0.00. Other people I know that use this say that it works great. One person thinks this is a tool MS uses to track down hackers.
