This is old, old, old software marketed as new stuff.  I've been ripped off. This, like everything else Microsoft touches these days, from the Ford Fusion's sync, through Windows 8, etc, is nothing but junk peddled on the rest of us so Microsoft can survive economically.  It is a has-been company as far as I'm concerned. :-(
