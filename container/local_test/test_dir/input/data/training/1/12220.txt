I purchased this software, hoping to experience the opportunity to design some slick personal calling cards.  What I got instead was a migraine!  The design backgrounds are GORGEOUS, but you have to have a PHD in graphic design to make this software work. I spent hours trying to make my chosen design fit within the print area of my standard Avery cardstock - I don't claim to be the brightest crayon in the box, but I'm pretty intelligent and resourceful and I wasn't able to do anything with it.  I'm glad I only spent [amt]. If you have the a lot of extra time and an unending supply of patience, give it a shot - If you don't choose another product, or go to Kinko's.
