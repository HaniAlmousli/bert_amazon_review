The last time I got the updated McAfee version, it added onto the previous year's subscription.  This time, it didn't, so I ended up losing a month of my old subscription because I added this code in early.  I guess I could call their service number to fix it, but that's always a pain.  It was so cheap anyway.

McAfee 2016 already found three viruses on my computer for which I'm grateful, but the three stars is for what it did to Windows after it told me I needed something like 30 updates for Windows.  I clicked the box to update everything and then Windows ceased to work.  I was in the middle of a project. It was stressful trying to restore, because the restore wasn't all that smooth.  Windows wouldn't let me back in, I couldn't get to the safe mode, etc.

Finally, I restored and everything is fine, but then McAfee said I needed Windows updates.  This time, I went to Windows to see, and I was completely up to date.  I'm sure updating Windows through McAfee would have put me in the same predicament I was in before. Why the discrepancy between the two?  I don't know, but I'm going to trust Windows on this.
