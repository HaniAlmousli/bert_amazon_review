This is my 14th review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: Off to the southwest and a shot at living life on an Arizona ranch!  Nancy Drew must discover why a phantom horse is seen every night whilst trouble follows immediately afterward via property destruction.

INITIAL SCORE: 83

CHARACTERS:

Dave Gregory : One of the most handsome men involved with ND games thus far, this ranch foreman is shy and seems to want to be more than friends with Nancy.  It never got weird or anything.  He lied to me, but I don't think I was invested enough in him to take it personally.

Tex Britten  : The ranch head wrangler that has no likeable personality.  Grunting out how I might fail goes only so far with me.

Shorty Thurmond: He looks a lot like my brother-in-law [balding & pronounced lips], so I had my guard up against him immediately.  He was an odd-looking dude. I don't know why picking the wrong vegetables were grounds for expulsion from the ranch. Don't you think the ranch owners should take personal responsibility for placing a novice with the obviously crucial task of picking out their food properly? Utterly ridiculous. They should be ashamed.

Mary Yazzie : A lot of reviewers didn't like her, but I thought she was fine. The love affair with Tex is understandable since both didn't get out too much.

Bess & George : The "stuck in the airport business" might seem overplayed, but judging from the realities of air travel life now, I would not doubt it could happen.  Between these two & the Hardy Boys, this game featured more hint systems than any other ND game out on the market. I can't say I liked it because I wanted to discover sleuthing for myself,  yet it was probably for the best since half the puzzles would have taken an extra four hours just by mental confusion. So in the end, I accepted it.

Ed & Bet Rawley: Owners of the Shadow Ranch I had mentioned early. Ed was annoying when he downplayed every single comment Bet made regarding Nancy & the adventure. He constantly acted as if Bet  was irritating him. I see this a lot with couples and I refuse to accept this as functional behavior. I give HER credit for the realism though!

 CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 81

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
The Magnificent Seven score was pretty enticing; made you feel triumphant! ha, ha. The Arizona desert had a beautiful appeal. The ghost town wasn't as great as other reviewers made it out to be. I didn't find it spooky nor engaging.  Lonely? yes

CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 83

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: I liked the trivia challenge in the corral. Nice touch!  The chicken coop wire puzzle was interesting. The slot machine at Cappy's seemed unnecessary but was fun to play.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 83

ADVENTURE ENDING: I guessed the culprit!!  The endgame [switching colored stones] seemed a rather hard concept for anyone to pick up without a walkthrough.  Again, I felt as if I invested all that energy into the story and there was no character payoff explanations on what happened in the weeks following [other than a 30 second update]. The actual treasure was a wonderful climax!!  I haven't seen that is a ND adventure before.

CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 84

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me four days [14 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 68

My Strong Points: I did reasonably well on the ranch chores, guessed the culprit [which I have done in 7 of the 14 games thus far], and stayed steady with the games'  pacing. I navigated the cliff dwellings maze real well.

My Weak Points: Walkthroughs were important to me in the second half, I got to admit. I stumbled on the bead pattern puzzle for some reason [forgot there was an email solution from my best friends], and I was stuck on one errant ingredient with the cake for nearly an hour!

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 68/ 2 = 76 [ B ]

BOTTOMLINE: This ranked # 2 in Best Game by the fans, but I thought it  was just simply average as ND games go.  I tend to get bored more easily when the adventure is not scary, but that is just my personal taste.  I'd recommend it and it has an outside shot of cracking my Top Ten Overall ND games!
