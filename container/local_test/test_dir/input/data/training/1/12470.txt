While going through my slushpile of things I never got around to reviewing, I found this... and then found out that Autodesk gave up on it almost as soon as they shipped it. That makes this a remarkably easy review to write -- just don't bother. There are low-end CAD products that fill the same niche; you can find some open source products on osalt.com, and Autodesk even makes a couple of low-end products specifically for nonprofessional users. The Maker community should be a good place to find specialized software for CAM software and equipment (especially CNCs and 3D printers), and there are a few architectural CAD programs meant for the intended Freestyle market too.
