My kids had been trying to create their own stop motion videos, having this software really helped quite a bit. Keep in mind, this is a software package geared towards extreme novices and children. What you can create won't be powerful, but it is a great way to start with working with stop motion and coming up with a final product that gets a flew claps from family. The program was easy to load and worked well with our laptops and using a nokia camera.
I can't really compare it to other programs because what this software promises is basic level stop motion (where other programs promise you will create professional looking final products). I can highly recommend this for people looking to learn the bells and whistles, if you need to do a quick project, or if you have kids interested in learning. If you are looking for something to submit to a Hollywood studio, this won't be the software package for you.
