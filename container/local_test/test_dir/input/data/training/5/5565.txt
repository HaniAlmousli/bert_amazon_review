This is really an amazing program for the money. I started out with Anime Studio Debut which was great but this is even better. One of the principal things I needed was multiple sounds tracks which this has and allows you to layer all kinds of sound effects voice overs and narration into one animation (debut only has two tracks so if you had two characters talking you had nowhere to put music, sound effects, etc.). The lip synching is awesome, it allows you to automatically sync a recording and the program assigns the right lip positions.  There are lots of ready to use cartoon characters in this version. You also have unlimited length of cartoon creation (debut has a limit of two minutes). The program also has a preview mode (lacking in debut).
