In two words.... Google Earth!!!
This application is slow as hell and it's not pretty.
The GUI sucks and it's a nightmare to import database to be mapped in the map.
No one should pay to get this application.  You can do 90% of what it claims on Google Earth and more.
I am so tired of Microsoft and it trying to do everything.  Just because you have money doesn't mean you can do thing better than other people with their original ideas.

I DO NOT recommend this application.
