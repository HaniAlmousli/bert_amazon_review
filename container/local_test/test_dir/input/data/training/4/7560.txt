There are quite a few things that I like about this product. First off, the software is downloaded directly online. Shipped is a cardboard envelope with a credit card sized card with an activation number to create an account. If you want to download the software on additional devices, simply connect to the internet with the device, go to your account page and install the software. No more having to store discs! The software itself is decent. I have only used it on my laptop, but I love it. There are occasional pop-ups, but you can choose not to see the messages again. I have used norton before, and one thing that drove me insane was the constant pop-up windows. You could disable them for up to a day, but then they would turn back on. If you want a hassle free software, both when installing and using that is not expensive, I highly recommend purchasing this product.
