Power and layout are the two big advantages to this USB hub.  This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says "T7Hub" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for "permanent" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.  The following hardware comes inside the box: the hub, its power supply, and a USB 2.0 cable.
