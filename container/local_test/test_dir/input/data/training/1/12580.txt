This product is made to help recover lost or stolen electronic items but there are many issues with it. I was letdown bigtime.

- It only works for Androids, PCs and Macs. What the ?????? no iPhones, Kindles or Chromebooks. Strike 1. To top things off, if someone steals your device, the thief can uninstall it. That's strike 2 right there.
- Sneak Peak is something I can't assess. Y? I only have iDevices.

I had no choice but to give it 1 star. I don't use android (except on my Kindle but it doesn't work on that) so that pretty much stops me in my tracks.
