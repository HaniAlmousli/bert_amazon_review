T Tax 2014 worked OK.  Two stars because the promised rebate has vanished into the ether wind.  All attempts to reach them on this matter has been to no avail.  The rebate won't make or break me, but its an Intuit integrity test, sort of.  This follows loud "Mea Culpas" from Intuit saying that they had screwed up.  Their promises and apologies rival those of a used car salesman.
