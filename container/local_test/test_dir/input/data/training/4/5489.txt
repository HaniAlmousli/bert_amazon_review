We get Kaspersky because we don't like Norton at all.  We have used this for 2 straight years and have had no problems with viruses.  We only had one problem with playing flash games on Facebook where we had to turn off the anti-banner in order for some of the flash games to work (like Farmville, Frontierville).  The installation was easy and was not too hard for an amateur like me.  We are buying Kaspersky 2012 to use shortly and have recommended this to other people in our family, who are also just basic computer users.  Almost the whole family has switched to Kaspersky from Norton.
