First of all this is a basic edition.  Some of the aspects of the full software are missing.  Second its very hard to import your own designs.  We're still having issues with that.

Still as a simple animation program it is easy to use.  You can take the characters provided and make them dance and move around in a very limited Hanna Barbara type 2d cartoon way.

My son who is very into learning 3d arts and has a desire to design video games played with it for a few days.  He made som interresting animations with it but grew bored in the end.

I'd say it is a good product for people new to animation like myself but for people with a prior experiance in creating their own, it will be found wanting.
