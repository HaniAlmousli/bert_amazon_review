I bought a $600 HP desktop and I was forced to purchase it with a 8.0 operating system.  After 5 hard disc crashes, I had the motherboard & drive replaced under warranty and I donated it to charity.  Because of the HP design type, I couldn't downgrade to 7.0 or upgrade to 8.1.

DO NOT EXPECT 8.0 or 8.1 to be Senior friendly when upgrading from XP.  Also, I had to purchase $300 in new software.

I ended up buying a new Dell XPS8700 with Windows 7.0 installed.

Lord Billy Gates kids really designed this 8.0 operating system for use with their toys.  Do yourself a favor!  Avoid being forced into purchasing this shoddy operating system with all its glitches.
