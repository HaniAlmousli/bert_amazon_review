The greatest strength of "Norton Internet Security 2002" lies not in its capabilities, but in its reasonable price. The well-integrated components (i.e: AntiVirus, Personal Firewall, Privacy Control, and Parental Control) combine to make an attractive one-pack bargain. They work fine too! Indeed, you will observe some flaws in the software, but forgive Norton, and take solace in the fact that (unlike Microsoft) Norton doesn't make your wallet bleed before you can acquire her products.
