It's adequate, but still no substitute for an attorney-produced will.  The options are decent if you don't want any variations, and there are a few options for limited variations, but not substantial.

This allows naming of beneficiaries as well as alternate beneficiaries if one or more of the primary beneficiaries does not survive the user.  It also allows naming of multiple alternate executors, or none at all (which allows the probate court to appoint one).  Also nice.

For many people, this will be quite adequate, if they've got an uncomplicated situation.

One feature I really did not like is the privacy policy.  I was unable to determine just how far Nolo will go with their privacy policy, but since the policy specifically applies to information they receive through the internet, and I was unable to determine just what is actually transmitted to them from the will itself, I was quite uncomfortable with that.  If NONE of the information in the will is ever transmitted to Nolo or their affiliates, great - but they should specify that in their privacy statement.  Failure to do so implies that they get to obtain the information contained in any of their software-created documents, since the software records it.  I was uncomfortable with the ways in which they empower themselves to use personal information, even though it's become somewhat standard.  With a request for my Social Security number as part of the will (optional, at least), that heightened my concern even further.  I've already had two highly significant data hacks (one through Blue Cross, and one through our own FedGov), so I guard my personal data far more closely these days.  The moment you register this product or download an update to the program, you've met the criteria in their privacy policy for them obtaining and using your information.  If users are comfortable with that, fine.  I just don't happen to be.

To be honest, now that I've tried this software, I do not anticipate replacing my current (and adequate) will with what this produced.  If I revise that position, I will update this review.
