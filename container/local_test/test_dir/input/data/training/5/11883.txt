H&R Block helped me get my taxes done with no problems.  I submitted my return electronically and received a check in about two weeks.  This software takes you step by step on all the possible deductions, etc.  I have been using H&R Block for a couple years now and will continue to do so as it is not as expensive as Turbo Tax, but you still get your bang for your buck.  No problems or issues with this software.
