You can put together a basic will with this, no problem - so long as you get your "what does that mean" dictionary out.  But if you want to be specific about certain things, it doesn't really help you write it in "the legal way" and often doesn't even give you the option.  I guess there is no way around dealing with a dang lawyer for everything... including death!  Great.
