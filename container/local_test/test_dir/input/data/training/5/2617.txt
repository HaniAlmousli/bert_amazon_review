OK here is the deal...  I got this 2 in 1 i5core/ 6GB/ 1TB hard drive machine on Christmas eve 2015 and it was unbelievably slow. I had to wait about 15 seconds to see a row of my pictures, downloads took extremely long, YouTube videos buffered at lease 10 times in one minute, updates kept popping up every time I turned this machine on. I began looking into replacing my NEW hard drive with a newer SSD hard drive and I was getting extremely stressed and pissed off. I mean, my girlfriends 5 yrs old $300 HP laptop was faster, so I called Asus tech support 1-888-678-3688. They talked me through a hard reboot and, "OMG!" This is the fastest computer ever! I don't know if it needed a factory update or what, but it is really fast. I can go on Netflix, YouTube, listen to music, watch picture, and surface yahoo news, with no buffering or delays.
