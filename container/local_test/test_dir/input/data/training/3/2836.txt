WARNING: TurboTax 2007 requires Microsoft .net software. Don't use TurboTax 2007 if you don't want to add, or don't have room for, .net. It seems like many programs I add (TuroTax 2007 is an example) require additional software that causes my computer to slow down more. Thus, numerous software additions cause numerous additions to computer slow down. I am mad at Intuit because I don't want .net; I wanted only TurboTax.
