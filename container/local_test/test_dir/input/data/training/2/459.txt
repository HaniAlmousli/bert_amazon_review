It is absolutely remarkable the cheers that a seemingly reliable computer operating system can produce.  It's as if we were led to believe for years that even a modicum of stability and interoperability were too much to ask for.  And we were.  The government needs no better proof of why a monopoly is bad for consumers than to add up all the crashes, incompatibilities, and lousy performance results that Windows has chocked up over the past twenty years.  Pathetic.  Those in the know will tell you that Windows has kept a cottage industry of computer technicians and troubleshooters gainfully (and lucratively) employed; to them, it has been the goose that laid the golden egg.  A big, fat egg.
Now we have XP.  It's only been out a short time, but it seems to be far more stable than its predecessors.  It's about time.  It still crashes from time to time and gets buggy when you try to "plug and play" various peripherals, but those problems haven't led to system meltdown yet.  Thankfully.  But we should have had an operating system like this from Microsoft years and years ago.  There is nothing technologically innovative or superior about Windows XP.  It simply works pretty well and most people should be happier with their computers than they've ever been.  (Windows 2000 is essentially Windows XP; I've heard the same kinds of comments about it:  It does what it is expected to do most of the time without bringing your system down.  Fingers crossed, it seems to actually be an operating system that isn't an Edsel.)
But there are operating systems out there that are well-ahead of Windows XP.  Mac OS X is such an operating system.  Much easier to use.  Much more stable.  Much more elegant.  Yet, because of the entrenched Windows monopoly, few give it a chance.  But, today, there is no reason to stick with Windows.  The new Mac OS is completely compatible with any Windows network (Mac OS X is based on UNIX, which is the most time-tested stable operating system ever, and also the basis for the industrial LINUX operating system), has all the popular programs that work on Windows (including a marvelous new Office for Mac X that bests the Windows version of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Entourage).  It also has the best multimedia programs in the business--none of which are available for Windows.  Burn CDs and DVDs, use the best mp3 player out there (the iPod), handle digital cameras and photographs effortless, make your own home movies without even cracking an owner's manual.  And, Apple has the best buy in a home computer system:  the new iMac G4.
Fight the power.  Try something else.  Linux.  Mac OS X.  Send a signal to Microsoft that it isn't going to be business as usual anymore.
