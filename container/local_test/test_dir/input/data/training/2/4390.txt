Right around the turn of the century it became very fashionable to mine the nostalgia of the latest crop of people who are now adults with paying jobs - Gen X, basically. The truth is that many of the pop culture artifacts that have seeped into our consciousness earned their place not by being very good but by being very repetitive. There are many, many shows I watched not because I was interested in them but because you couldn't swing a television remote without catching Happy Days, The Brady Bunch, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, etc. If you were a kid on a Saturday morning, this meant you couldn't avoid Land of the Lost.

Land of the Lost was never very good, but it didn't matter to me: It was the only way I was going to see monsters on television. Back then, any monster special effects were relegated to the big screen, and since I wasn't allowed to see most movies that featured them Land of the Lost was the only way I was going to see dinosaurs - even if they were poorly animated puppets or claymation. So you better believe I watched every bizarre episode I could, even if it never made any sense, the acting was frequently terrible, and the sets, costumes, and actors looked like they were made of rubber.

Producers who decide to update these nostalgia icons have a choice: revamp the terrible show with utter seriousness (think "Lost in Space") or shamelessly mock it instead. "Land of the Lost" chooses to mock its source material.

The problem is that it's not a loving mockery made by fans. It's clear the producers didn't do their homework. Oh they got some things right - they mimic the look-and-feel of the Sleestaks, of Cha-Ka, and Grumpy the dinosaur (sans claymation). But the innocent wonder is replaced with a smarmy, cynical approach that makes Will Ferrell out to be kind of a jerk.

The three main characters are paleontologist Rick Marshall (Ferrell), student Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel, sporting a variety of tight t-shirts), and randomly inserted gift shop owner and foil to Marshall, Will Stanton (Danny McBride). They fall through a wormhole, they have to get back, Sleestaks, dinosaurs, yadda-yadda, the end. Marshall's rivalry with Matt Lauer (as himself) over the existence of time warps is the funniest thing about the film.

Ferrell, who pretty much plays the same character in whatever movie he's in, doesn't have a warm cast to temper his antics. Instead he goes through a series of contrived set-ups with a punch line that ends in dinosaur excrement. This joke is used no less than three times. Scriptwriter Chris Henchy needs to find some new material.

And that's the thing. If you're not familiar with the original TV series, this is just another semi-amusing entry in Ferrell's oeuvre with dinosaurs thrown in. But the whole point of reimagining the series was to lure those fans back into the theater, and instead they ended up with a bunch of dino poop.
