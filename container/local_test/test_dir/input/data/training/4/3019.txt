I have a MacBook Pro and previously owned the MS Office 2004 edition.  When I first converted from a PC, I found myself stumbling around the 2004 applications looking for things.  The 2007 release of MS Office changed to a "ribbon" interface that is similar to the toolbar setup of MS 2008 for Mac.  It should make for a smoother transition for new MS Office for Mac users.  But besides that, the interface for 2008 is neater and more organized.  I've also found the performance to be much faster than the previous version, and not as prone to crashing.

At home, I use MS Office 2008 for Mac for editing and reviewing work files.  I also use the Excel to keep track of personal spreadsheets.  I find both of these very easy to use and love having the ability to have these programs on my Macintosh.  A student version of the program probably would have been sufficient for me based on my past use.  While I do not need the functionality at home, the stripping of the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is an issue for some users that they should consider before upgrading.  There is also no Analysis Toolpak, which again is only a concern for higher-level users.

However, the Microsoft Project Gallery is a great new application that I did not have on my 2004 student version of the MS Office software.  You can create business cards, brochures, flyers, calendars, stationary, resumes, envelopes, labels, etc.  It's kind of like a bonus "PrintShop" being bundled with the software... but with some very professional - and also some fun, sleek -templates.  The 2008 version also adds Microsoft Exchange capability to the e-mail program Entourage - a huge plus for those who use Microsoft Outlook at work and what to sync their e-mail at home.

Overall, I highly recommend this product.  I would recommend that you research the differences between each version of MS Office 2008 for Mac prior to purchase.  This will ensure you are getting all the features you need.  If your budget allows, this version is great to give yourself some features that may take a while to grow into.  But once you do, you will be happy to have them.
