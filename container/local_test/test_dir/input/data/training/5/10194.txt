I've used only one Rosetta Stone program previously, and I did so for an unconventional purpose, to assist a learning disabled child better acquire English skills. It was quite useful and I recommended it highly.

This new reading program is just as good and I daresay can be used with children even younger than the recommended 3 years of age, since it includes shapes and symbols as well as letters and reading basics.

As others have noted, this program includes 50 individual exercises and innumerable activities. It does indeed encourage literacy even in the preliterate infants and toddlers.

No child is too young to read to.

It's no good trying to keep kids away from computers. I tried and it doesn't work. The trick is to integrate reading and literacy into the computer experience, and this program helps parents do that starting at a very young age.

Highly recommended
