First off I did like using this software. It was simple to install, easy to use and functioned well.

The problem that I see AVG having is, proving enough worth for people to jump from the free version of their software to something that requires a yearly fee. A couple years ago I moved from Norton's to McAfee and then finally to AVG. I enjoyed it for the simplicity that it is. There is no bloated resource drain, etc. It does what it does well and easy.

Granted there are a few extra bells and whistles under the hood of the paid version but, is it enough for the average user? In my opinion not really. For an average user like myself who does web surfing, email, and that's about it the added layers of security will largely go unnoticed or under utilized.

Don't mistake this review though. AVG is very good software. There is a good value here but when a company gives away a version of something for free there needs to be a little more punch to get me to upgrade to a premium version.
