Junk.  I had Quicken Premier 2013 and I wish I had stayed there.  It worked.  That's all I wanted.  Someone dreamed up some convoluted password scheme for the financial institutions and it DOES NOT WORK.  Quicken is quick-en to blame password changes (that I have not done in several years).  If I could revert, I would.  InTWIT was sure to state that once you upgrade and convert your files, there is no going back.  In other words, you're hooked, and screwed.  Time to try to recover my data, if possible, and find another software solution that hasn't been farmed out (off-shored) to a cheaper developer with no real-world QA.

I've been a Quicken devotee for at least 20 years.  I'm done.  If they don't care, neither do I.

I bought my CD directly from InTWIT as they offered a price slightly less than Amazon (I am a devoted Amazon buyer), but I wanted to reach the widest audience.
