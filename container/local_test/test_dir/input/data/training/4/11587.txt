I took a chance on this Instant Immersion Spanish software because the product description said that it was only for Windows; however, the photo showed "PC and Mac" on the spine of the box.  Since I knew that the all-access portion worked on iPads, I figured that reinforced my hunch.  And yes, it does work with Mac and iPad, as well as Windows 8.1 machines.  (I have not tried it with Windows 10.)

To start learning Spanish, all you need to do is pop in the software DVD and install it on your computer.  If you do not have a DVD drive or if you are installing on a tablet, you need to visit the website to enter your email address and product key to begin the download.  The box also contains an interactive DVD and an MP3 audio CD.  I like that I can copy the audio to iTunes, although it's a little weird how it adds files to my Mac desktop in order to accomplish this.  It sounds like an extended game of Pong.

The software itself is pretty good, although your success will depend in part on how well you tend to grasp foreign languages.  All the PR around Instant Immersion language courses compares them to Rosetta Stone.  I can't make the comparison myself, having never tried Rosetta Stone, but I do know that this is a relatively easy method of teaching yourself Spanish, as long as you take advantage of all the tools.  I find that the trio of reading, speaking, and listening to the same words and phrases helps me learn faster.  I've tried other language courses that leave out one or the other, and that's much more difficult.  The pocket phrase guide, while extremely portable, is difficult to see with older eyes, and it's not necessarily easy to find what I want, even though the words/phrases are grouped by subject, such as days of the week or transportation.  Still, it's better than no guide at all.

This software teaches Latin American Spanish, which is great for most Americans but not so great if you plan to go to Spain.  I cannot find a way to change to European Spanish, so I assume that option is not available.  The iPad Talk Now app mirrors the computer version, which makes it easy to train yourself on one, then switch off to the other.  The Oscar Lake game will appeal to a wide range of ages.

I've used an older Instant Immersion program for Italian, and I find this newer version of the software to be less clunky and visually more friendly, something that's important if children will be using it.  This program is best for learning a smattering of Spanish, not for an in-depth learning program that covers the finer points of grammar and word nuances.  If your aim is to be able to converse a little or understand important written words, this is a great program.
