This is an awful product.

When I needed it most, it failed me.

It would not resize automatically the hard drive as the one that I put in to replace the one that busted, was larger.  It would not work.  Problem after problem after problem.

The only way I could get a restore done was through windows.  And then... my machine would drop off of the domain.  Anyone who has a domain knows that when you "join" a domain, Windows resets your profiles... and it takes as much time to set everything back up as it would to just reinstall windows and everything else from scratch.

Acronis support, though, didn't seem to understand this until 4 or 5 emails into the email request for support.

You know, I really love the boot disk that Acronis makes.  I really love that it's easy to use.  But I hate that it's one issue after another and tech support is just not that great.  What I hate most though... is that this software failed me when I needed it most.

It was eventually recommended I use Acronis Workstation... and so we gave that a shot too only because my workstation is technically connected to a domain (even though it's just my own server) but even that did not work well at all.

I really gave Acronis a lot of grief and I do commend them... they maintained their customer service the entire time, over multiple months of trying to work things out.

I would not touch Acronis 2012 with a 10 foot pole!  That is just my opinion though.
