I installed this over XP as part of a general upgrade; CPU, motherboard, more memory and a video card for my wife's PC (yes I am a tinkerer).  Installed cleanly.  In spite of being SP1 it screwed around for several days downloading and installing upgrades - a minor annoyance (with cable internet - would be ugly with dialup).  Looks good, runs good, no crashes (although XP was pretty stable in my environment).  Of the upgrades I added a new copy of Windows Office home and student ed so the thing is pretty clean these days.  My wife didn't jump for joy at any of this but she's acting like she's pretty comfortable with it and now she uses it a lot (the whole thing is considerably faster) and that's as high a compliment as you get from that quarter.  Yeah I hate that it's constantly asking permission (I'll get in and fix that shortly).  I don't hate that it blocks popups.  The final results were worth the trouble (there was not much)to me.
