Here were the ups and mostly downs of this for me.

Ups:
-Easy to load
-Forms use the traditional quicken approach of making you take a quiz and then automatically filling out the information
-Couple of the sample letters and policies were relevant to me

Downs:
- Only 2 of the forms were relevant to me running a one-member LLC that I might actually need to use one day
- Only 2 of the sample letters were ones I might use one day
- Only one of the e-library books included is one I might use one day

Caveat to my rating: I use a service very inexpensively that set up my LLC and does necessary filings for me (e.g. minutes). This may have greater value to a DIY person who hasn't yet started their own business or have a business where they sell goods, hire people and or lease out property.
