I have used previous versions of Kaspersky with great success. This version is toatlly different from past versions. It is complicated to find and figure out ANY settings. They went to a new format for setting things up, everything is now in a hidden file, different page, obscure setting with abstract abbreviations, technical descriptions and many unknown features and what they do or how to set them.
I had it installed for about 4 months, downloaded a malware, the malware destroyed all the settings in Kaspersky, It infected my computer, I had to use Malwarebytes to rid it of these maladies. While the malware was removed, it left crumbs everywhere, my computer was starting while it was in sleep or hibernate, would start programs without being seen while I had it on, Kaspersky sat idly by and did nothing. As I got into the program, I found that Kaspersky was reset to allow incoming traffic. There was no warning, it just let it come in.
Very disappointed by the letdown. Am now looking for a new program to replace this one.
