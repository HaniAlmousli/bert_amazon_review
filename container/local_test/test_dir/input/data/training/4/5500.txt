I have been using Kapersky Internet Security for a few years, intermingled with AVG's product.  I have stopped using McAfee as installation of the product is challenging, even for them; and have stopped using the consumer version of Symantec's product as it is annoyingly helpful.  Kaspersky is there, it works, and it does not need a lot of care or feeding.  I recommend it.
