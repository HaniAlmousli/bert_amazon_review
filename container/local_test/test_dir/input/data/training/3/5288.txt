After installing WinZip 15, I noticed that for a big job it's a drag on my Intel dual-core CPU when it is processing files. It really slows down all the other programs while it is creating a zip file.

The advertising states, "WinZip 15's refined menu designs and more intuitive icons improve upon the WinZip interface, delivering an even better user experience." But I did not find this to be the case. You can still right click on a file or folder to get the old WinZip menu, but using the "more intuitive icons" and new WinZip interface did not produce a good experience for me. I clicked on Help and went to the article for "How to compress the contents of a folder."  The directions stated: "You can easily zip a folder using the WinZip ribbon interface. To do this: Start WinZip and click the New WinZip File icon. Type the name you wish to use, and click Create. Click the Add Files button on the ribbon..."  The problem was that after I entered a file name and clicked Create, there was no "Add Files button" on the ribbon like was shown in the documentation.  Looking at the location on the ribbon where the "Add Files button" was supposed to be, there was only the "Zip" button.

I also found that WinZip 15 could be somewhat of a security risk. I created a zip file and selected the option to move the desired files to the new zip file. By selecting the move option, the original files were deleted after they were moved into the zip file. I did this several times. Imagine my surprise when I later found out that the files that Winzip had deleted were in my recycle bin. That is not cool.

I looked at upgrading this $50 Standard Plus version to the Pro version.  But I received an error message that my copy of Standard Plus version 15.5 could not be upgraded to Pro.
