No internet software out there seems to make anyone happy, so perhaps my expectations are lower.  This was easy to install and has added bonus of additional devices being covered.  It does seem to use resources (according to data in computer), but not so bad that it very noticeable.  Otherwise, once it's set up, which does take some steps, it seems ok.
