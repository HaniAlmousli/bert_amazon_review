Have used TurboTax for years.  Because of some special tax considerations associated with recently acquired property, I have used a tax preparation service for the past couple of years.  HOWEVER, I still buy TurboTax and use it to do my own estimate before carrying my information to the tax service.  Always like to know what to expect and this is a good check on the tax service's work.
