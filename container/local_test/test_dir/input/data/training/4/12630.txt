I will start out by saying that if you own or are planning to start a small business, this type of software is an absolute necessity.  If you think you'll just wing it and get it later when you're in a better position to do so, don't.  Trust me, I've been there and before you know it you will have a backlog of papers, information, data etc. that you absolutely can't catch up on. This is literally your business organizer - for finances, customer information, employees, and paperwork.  It's a good alternative to Quickbooks.

I've noticed several comments about the user interface seeming a little dated.  While I agree with that, it does give it somewhat of a no-frills feel that might be preferred for people dealing with so much information and I don't feel its functionality is compromised or lessened in any way because of that.  One thing I like is that there is plenty of support to help you learn each aspect of the software.  There are short video tutorials to show you what you can do with the software and how it benefits you.  Also, there are cheat sheets for you to print out to help you get going.

This will help you track payroll and deductions for employees.  You can create quotes and invoices and post payments from customers and for your vendors.  You can make payments and partial payments.

And its important to remember that you don't have to use all of these features if they don't apply to your business.  It's just important that you keep together all your business information and it will make running your business go so much more smoothly.  In the long run, you will save an enormous amount of time.
