When deciding on an operating system (OS), several factors come into play. Will this OS be intalled onto a laptop or desktop? Is it networked? Will I use this for "business type applications" or "personal type applications"? Do I need strong multimedia capabilities?
Windows 2000 Professional is an extremely stable OS. After running it for almost two weeks non-stop, I never had a single problem. Crashes and the infamous "blue screen of death" became obsolete things of the past (unless you're using ME). As long as I did what the OS told me, for example not installing unsigned drivers, the OS behaved the way I wanted it to.
Windows 2000 is also an excellent machine for networking, which is simplified by helpful wizards that will guide even a novice through. Because it is so simple to accomplish, this is a favorite OS for laptop users and businesses.
Windows 2000 lacks multimedia capabilities found in Windows ME. Some very simplistic multimedia functions are lost in this OS... If you are finding a gaming system, this is NOT it. Another downfall is that many of the drivers are special for 2000, because it lacks the DOS background in ME. This is very similar to XP. Do not worry about this problem however, because almost all equipment will have 2000 drivers.
Finally, Windows 2000 looks a lot like ME, making it convenient for an individual who is used to the 9x/ME environment to convert over to the 2000 environment, without crossing over the problems of ME.
This is a great OS, however, for the individual desiring the stability and power of this NT based system, as well as the multimedia components of 9x/ME, Windows XP Professional is the way to go...
