This review is written by my 16-year old daughter who installed the software (with a little help from me) and started using it.

"The RosettaStone Version 4: French Level 1,2 & 3" is a fun, engaging introduction to learning a new language.

The program comes with three corresponding Audio Companion CDs PER LEVEL, for a total of 12 disks of instructional software in one product. (The Audio Companion software can be downloaded to an MP3 player). Each Level has four different units, for each of which you practice Pronunciation, Vocabulary, Phrases, Speaking, and more. RosettaStones' unique feature is its use of "language immersion" as a teaching tool. The program shows you images and the corresponding French words for what is in the pictures. There is no direct English-to-French vocabulary translation (that I've seen thus far), and this makes learning the language more enjoyable and more natural. The graphics are very aesthetically pleasing as well.

The audio software is one of the best parts about this program. The product comes with a USB Headset Microphone, and the program uses voice recognition software for you to practice pronunciation. Better yet, you can record yourself saying the same phrase several times and then play it back to listen to your progress and compare your pronunciation to that of a native speaker.

One drawback to the program is that you cannot pause a lesson easily if you need to see something again. You have to wait until the end of the lesson and then go back to particular part of it, but this is a minor inconvenience that does not take away too much from the program's quality.

I've only begun to use RosettaStone, but I am very pleased with the product thus far and will continue to use it."
