I bought a new Vista computer a little over a year ago. It came with a "Easy" Media Creator 9 teaser. I bought the upgrade to Creator 10 "because it was Vista-compatible". Yeah, sure.

After finding it to be trash, I set it aside for a year. Then I went back to get a software update. Would you believe a 1,500 MB download? The updated version does not do what I want it to do. I open the Video Converter and it takes quite a while to open. But if you wait it out you can click on Add Movies and a malformed screen opens with some text partially obscured. The hourglass cursor comes up and nothing happens again. No error message, just a sickening view of crapware.

I'll be uninstalling this garbage and replacing it with several small programs from companies that have software support in case I have problems.

I'm tired of small companies becoming large companies that lose track of what the customer wants. Selling a product may make the quarterly results look better but some of us remember what an awful experience it was with a particular brand and will never buy it again.

If you think I'm just a sourpuss, check my other reviews.
