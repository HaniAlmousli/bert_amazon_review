I don't think this is a program that will really teach someone a whole language despite it's stated advertisement to that effect.

I do think this is a good program to use hand in hand with another. Such as attending a Spanish class or even better, hanging out with Spanish speaking friends.

The interface is easy to use for adults and kids alike. The vocabulary drills and quizzes are mildly entertaining, at least in small doses.

Having never used Rosetta I can't compare the two except to say at 10% or less of the Rosetta price I think this is well worth the expenditure as a supplementary way to practice the Spanish language.
