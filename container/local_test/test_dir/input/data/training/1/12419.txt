I ordered this product because it ws suggested that in order to transfer the video camera footage or use with Final Cut Pro I needed this or another program like this. I wish I had purchased another program because this one doesn't work properly and the customer service/Tech support is outrageously bad. In fact, I am going to complain with the BBB and any other places I can because the company is actually fraudulant as the product does not work as advertised.

One of the features that I specifically wanted to use was the Blu-ray recording onto a DVD. But this feature is locked and cannot be openned with the Software Code. Why it should be locked I don't know!

When I tried contacting Tech Support, this can only be done by signing into the Roxio website and writing them. Then they write back a bunch of irrelevent questions that if you don't answer within a very short period of time; they close your question and you have to contact them again. Also, in order to answer any of their stupid questions you have to log in and go to your ticket number and write your response, etc.

Of course, this starts adding up, because different people answer the response and replys and they never give you any usable advice. I'm not in the habit of calling people names but the so-called tech supporters are total idiots! I'll answer a question or tell them that my computer is not capable of taking a screen capture and they just totally ignore what you said like they can't understand English.

The last suggestion and most likely final one is that I needed to ask Amazon for the Key Code to opne up their plug-in (which I paid for). I did contact Amazon, even though the it was completely ludicrous, that they would have the key code. Of course, they said that Roxio should have the key code on file. Roxio is responsible for Roxio software, not I and not Amazon!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE DO NOT PURCHASE ROXIO PRODUCTS!!!
