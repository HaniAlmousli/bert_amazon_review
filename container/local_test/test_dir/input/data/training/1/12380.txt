I gave BitDefender an honest try, hoping that it would provide better protection than the horrible McAfee I was dealing with before. Unfortunately, it did not. BitDefender Total Security 2009 is a complete mess. It locked up my computer when it was trying to scan, to the point where web pages would freeze and then 10 minutes later they'd herky-jerk back to life for a minute, then freeze up again. After a frustrating encounter with a lack of quality customer service, I had to uninstall it and get rid of it for good because I just could not take it anymore. I've since switched to Avast and had absolutely no issues at all with scans or freezing. Bottom line, unless you want a major headache, pass on BitDefender.
