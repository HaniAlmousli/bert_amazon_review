This works fine... but is unnecessary.  You can use online free products like yousendit.com and sizeablesend.com and many others (just google).  It would be fine if it allowed huge downloads but you are limited to 2gb and you pay 120 a year.  I can't tell what people have downloaded.  I see no benefit to this except that it automatically zips.  If you use the free products and you have more than one file to send, you zip them into 1 first.  This does that automatically.  Big deal. Just highlight the files and right click compress files and you have zipped them.  you don't have to pay all of those dollars for this product.  It seems to work online anyway.
