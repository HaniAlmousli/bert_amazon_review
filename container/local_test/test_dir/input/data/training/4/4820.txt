I'm writing this review using Dragon NaturallySpeaking. I haven't edited this review of (should be "at") all (other than to make corrections in parentheses). Dragon NaturallySpeaking does a good job of recognizing my voice. The caveats are that you need to be in a quiet room and you need to enunciate clearly for the product to work as advertised. I use Dragon NaturallySpeaking with the Sam Sun (should be "Samson") USB studio condenser microphone.

If you're a slow typist and you need a way to speed up the amount of texture (should be "text you are") producing Dragon NaturallySpeaking is a good solution. As a doctoral student I write many papers and have found Dragon NaturallySpeaking to be useful. The other side of the coin is that my brain is trained to type doctoral papers, not speak them. With a little training and patience  Dragon NaturallySpeaking can be your best friend. Dragon NaturallySpeaking's training tools are almost too powerful - I didn't find I needed to use them to get the product working effectively. however, I have absolutely no accent and I am a broadcast trained speaker.

The operating system I installed Dragon NaturallySpeaking on was Windows 7 64-bit edition.
