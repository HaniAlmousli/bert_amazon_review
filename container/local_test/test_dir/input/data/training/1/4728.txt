This program should have been named Quicken Unessentials.  The budgeting program is useless, it will only show you a budget for 3 months, not YTD (who does budgeting for one quarter of the year?).  It is impossible to enter mortgage or car loans and do general financial or retirement planning.  All this program is good for is downloading your credit card or bank account statements, and you can do that for free by going to your bank's website.

After two years, Intuit has not improved the program.  The only update "improvement" was to include a password to start the program (hello, computer programming 101).  No improvements to budgeting or other features the program is lacking.  Now, Intuit is offering a Lion version of Quicken 2007.  Sounds like they are about to dump this program if they are sending people back to the previous one.
