This modem works with Linux, at least the distros that I've been experimenting with (not Ubuntu, which I gave up on a long time ago so I didn't test this modem with Ubuntu, but rather some of the other Linux versions). I haven't tried all the fancy features of the modem (fax, etc) because I don't need that stuff, but dial-up works. I had some problems getting the modem's speaker to be silent, but I think that's probably an issue with my Linux software, and probably not a problem with the modem itself. Given my earlier frustrations with so-called "WinModems", I'm just happy to finally have this Zoom modem that actually works.
