For those that need a basic accounting system, this is probably a good system.  It is easy to install on the computer system and it is fairly simple to install.  What you need to do is evaluate what you need and make sure that this is what you need.

What you need to do in choosing an accounting system is to determine what you business needs are and if this needs them.  No review is going to tell you this. Choice of an accounting system is very personal and the wrong decision can hurt your business.  Therefore, I will not list the pluses and minuses of this as an accounting system.  What I will say is that it is user friendly.
