Over three years ago, the IRS began requiring excruciating detail on securities transactions for Form 1041 Trust returns.  This requires using Form 8949 to support data entry to Schedule D.  And over three years later, HR Block Software doesn't support the ability to import securities transaction data (downloaded from your broker) to the Tax prep program so the multiple form 8949s and Schedule D can be created, and all totals rolled into your final return for eFiling.  If you have more than a handful of investment transactions, plan on spending a month of Sundays entering all the data by typing one field at a time.  Or, go to an external service who will prepare the forms from your downloaded data into PDF files, where you can then manually assemble it into your Tax Return.  So who needs to pay for HR Block for Business software if you have to do all that??

Hundreds of users on online forums have been complaining about this, but HR Block never addresses this critical lack of data import capability in the Business package.
