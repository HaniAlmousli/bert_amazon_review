Our daughter tried multiple times to put this on her notebook, and was unable to complete an installation.  She got error messages, and even crashed.  Bad disc?  Most likely, but it's pretty hard to review something when it won't work.  Sorry AVG....  (I will say that my wife has been pleased with the AVG free antivirus over the years.  The ONLY actual infection of her computer - and it was bad - came several years ago when she was still using Zone Alarm.  We've since moved WAY beyond that product!  She's had AVG (free) ever since, with a Comodo firewall, until very recently.)
