For the most part I just needed something that was not a memory hog for basic word processing and simple calculations here and there.  On a regular notebook I tend to use an older version of MS Office with Word and Excel but while on the road I use a slimmed down netbook a lot more often for which this Corel Office product is suitable.

I also tend to use a portable external hard drive regardless of which computer I'm using so it is important to be able to go back and forth between the Microsoft and Corel file formats.  Given my basic needs and the huge cost differential between this and MS Office, Corel Office works just fine.

I do like this better than Open Office which is similar and may be downloaded for free.  Overall it is the Paint Shop Pro of office suites.  Chances are it may not meet the needs of the most demanding users but does have sufficient functionality and capabilities for most basic activities that one would typically use an office suite for.
