It did not take long to figure out the menu system and figure out how to use this program.

Initially, when I wanted to save I was frustrated because there were no menus along the top and Control-S did not trigger saving.  A quick look around revealed a disk icon to the right of the picture.  If you are familiar with basic icon meanings (crop, delete, email , print, etc.) this is a quick visual navigation.  If you are unsure you can hover over the icon and an explanation will hover by the icon.

This program has basic controls such as crop, `quick fix', red eyes, blemish fix, brightness, black and white, and so on.  The blemish fix allow for control of size and strength.  It works okay but would not be my first choice for blemish fixing.  A more powerful video and photo editing package is&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Photoshop-Premiere-Elements-8/dp/B002IJA1DC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Photoshop & Premiere Elements 8</a>

This package offers many creative options that are very easy to use.  Calendars, photo books, uploading to popular web sites and much more.
The organizer is easy to use and a quick way to manage a variety of digital formats.
However,  if you are looking for a simple, very easy to learn to use editing package this is very simple with a quick learning curve.
