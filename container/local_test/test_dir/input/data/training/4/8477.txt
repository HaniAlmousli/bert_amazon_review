Our government is pretty intimidating and especially with the personal income tax system. Rather than hours of trying to figure out government instructions with their tax forms, I use TurboTax, and their e-filing for both FED and State, and their audit insurance program. I once worked my way through an IRS audit just after I liquidated a small business at a great loss. The IRS agent came to my home and offered her my PC which had Quicken and QuickBooks and she worked on it for a few days. Then I moved to California and continued with the IRS through ten rounds of mail and response. The IRS found my books clear and well-supported, but the time spent was considerable, and the tummy acid on my side even more so. So I pay for Turbotax plus add-ons. What we really need  is a serious tax reform where filing is on one sheet of paper.
