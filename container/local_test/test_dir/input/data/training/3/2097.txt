The software is certainly user friendly and does what it should (this is my third year of using it) but don't take any stock on the touted "I have people" campaign.  I received notice from the IRS regarding a 2006 return and was left on hold for one hour until I finally gave up.  I then tried to email them from their web site; typed in all the information then got the message that a server error was encounted, please try some other time.  So, if you are trying to make the choice between this product and Turbo Tax, don't let a warm and fuzzy feeling of audit support sway you; make your decision based on the functionality of the software itself.  Next year, I'll give their competitor a try.
