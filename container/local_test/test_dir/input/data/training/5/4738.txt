I've always been impressed with Webroot. I've been a fan of Spysweeper for awhile now and decided to try their antivirus software. It goes without saying that this is one of the best programs out now that combines spyware detection software and virus detection software all in one. It runes silently and barely can be noticed running in the background. Doesn't affect my games or tasks and processes one bit. It has a "gamer mode" to limit it's activities so as not to intrude upon your games resources. I've never had to use this but that could be because my computer is pretty decent. Scans silently, you wouldn't even notice it's running if it wasn't for the tray icon which you can hide in Windows 7. Simple to use and it works. Rarely do I come across spyware or viruses as much as I used to but when I did Spysweeper would take care of what I needed it to do. It would stop intrusions before they entered your system. When I first tried Spysweeper years back I needed it to eliminate a problem that had already infested my pc. Ever since the first time I tried it a few years back it worked so perfectly I became a fan instantly. It's a good choice for anyone looking for spyware and virus protection all in one.
