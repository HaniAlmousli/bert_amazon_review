Ive used Turbo Tax until last year. I thought for the price I would take a chance on Tax Cut. It was after all a substantial price difference.

Right away I though the learning curve for TaxCut was a little steeper & it seemed I had to actually do some thinking when it was asking me questions. (Oh Darn!) The phraseology was slightly confusing but not overwhelming.

However, I got through it, the return was correct & it wasn't so difficult that I will go back to TT next year. I think TT is a better product that seems to have been thought out more, but that could be that TT has been around for much longer, I believe. Turbo Tax is far more expensive but I don't think the benefits of TT ( at least in my case ) justify the extra cost.
As far as the e-file, I have never used it & don't really care about that.
I just need a sensible guide to doing my senseless tax forms & Tax Cut was a great help & worth the minimal cost.
