This is a PCI card to add USB to an older computer; 3 slots on the back and one internal--this card included a USB slot in a drive-bay cover, which you can install if you've got a free bay on your PC, connecting it to the internal USB slot with a supplied cord.  The card works great on my P3-800 at work, running Windows 2000.  Installed without a bit of trouble, and works perfectly.  Following the installation directions had me up and running in a few minutes, and the PC recognized the card and loaded the drivers (which I'd put on from the install CD) immediately without a single hitch.  Good as it gets!
