This is a robust mapping program that goes beyond&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Streets-Trips-2009/dp/B001EHXOFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Streets & Trips 2009</a>to add features such as the ability to input data from Excel or Access.

It creates clear driving directions that can be emailed as a picture or as an attachment.  The map (either as an attachment or as a picture in the email) is high quality and easy to read.  The email with map and directions was only about 260KB

Another great feature is you can customize fuel cost and MPG city/highway to get fuel cost estimates for the routes that are being planned

Another handy feature is the ability to turn a map into a web page then easily integrates it into your site with either a simple web creator or one such as Front Page or Dreamweaver.

This is probably much more robust than what I needed but it will serve me well being able to email customized directions to my home office for my clients.  In the future I may use it as a tool to map where my clients are located and perhaps develop some marketing tools.

If you are looking for a more robust mapping program to intergrate with data this could very well be the ticket.  If you are just looking for some good mapping program consider Microsoft Streets and Trips.
