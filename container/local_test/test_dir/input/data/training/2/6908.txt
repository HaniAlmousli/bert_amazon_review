Windows 8 and it's spawn 8.1 really suck.  I had bought a new laptop with windows 8.  It might be good for a tablet or phone; but on a computer, it is a bloody torture.  And of course, here comes the Blue Screen of Death! They even put an emoticon of a frowny face on it.  What operating system would have a song singing, "honestly, I want to see you be brave?" Honestly? Bravery is not what you need to run a laptop.  You should open it, start it, have it be easy and work.
