I just recently converted to this version from Office 2004 for Mac, and I wish I'd just kept my original software. This version is buggy, slow, and crashes likes someone's paying it to do so I can't tell you how many times Word has crashed in the middle of updating an important file and the supposed "AutoRecovery" file is from hours earlier. Yes, it's my own fault for not saving more often, but when you're in the groove, you're in the groove. That doesn't excuse this program's fault, and they've got some nerve charging this much for an update that's not worth the disk it's burned on. I won't even talk about how slow PowerPoint is. It takes a few minutes to open on my brand-new iMac as well as on my 2007 MacBook, so I know it's not processor speed that's causing the problem. In fact, the only program I can recommend on this disk is Excel, and that's bc it's pretty hard to screw that one up.

In this day and age, it's pretty much impossible to be a Mac user working across platforms without having Office, so if you must, take my advice and just stick to 2004. Hopefully they'll get rid of the bugs in the next update, but I'm not holding my breath.
