I test security products and when I went to buy this, I was a little skeptical. The web protection it provides is GREAT! However, the actual file protection it offers is a little weak in my opinion. It still kinda seems to rely more on its web guard than it does actual file protection.

The other thing I noticed with this product is it says it comes with a year's worth of protection for Macintosh. When I got this in the mail, only PC protection was in the box, no Mac protection. It should have 2 stars but I'm being nice about that.
