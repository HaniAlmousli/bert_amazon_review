Piece of junk.  I get a white screen when running the program.  McAfee has all these sorts of fixes and the like, but none of them work.  They variously claim that its: (1) a windows issue, (2) a IE issue, (3) a java issue, and all sorts of other issues, but just blame it on the customer.  RUN as far as you can from this crock of junk.
