I used an earlier versions of Pinnacle (6 I think) quite awhile ago, but found it to be unstable so I purchased Premiere Elements, and the upgraded to Premiere Pro. So, I was a little skeptical but I'm glad I tried it. This version is a great mid-range video editing suite.
The workspace is similar to that of Premiere with files and effects on the left, storyboard on the bottom, and preview window at the top right. Navigation is fairly simple, and items are easy to click and drag around the storyboard.
This program is packed with extra features and effects, making it a great program for making your own videos.
While I did find this program to be much more stable than the older version, I did have it fail to render one video. All I had to do was close the program, open the project up and export again. That only happened once after many successful renders, so I don't think it will happen again.
I prefer this program to Premiere Elements, and think that if you want a program with versatility and great effects without the cost of Premiere Pro this is the program to use.
