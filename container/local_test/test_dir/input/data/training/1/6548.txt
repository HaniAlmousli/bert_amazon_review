This operating system has caused us nothing but trouble. Looking after more than 300 clients in New York we have seen a never ending array of incompatibilities and failures, simple things like the most common printer drivers fail to install, USB devices are not detected and the drivers available do not work. About half of all systems we tried to upgrade from windows 8 to 8.1  failed during the upgrade. This is really the new Vista, right up there with Windows ME. If you need to upgrade from XP move to Windows 7.
Shooting yourself in the foot it is probably less painful than dealing with the Windows 8 upgrade.
