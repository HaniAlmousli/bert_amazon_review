This is a pretty solid video editing program for Windows users.  Compared to Windows Movie Maker, this is a great piece of software.  As with most video editing computer programs, you'll find that you should have the beefiest system you can afford.  I have x3 installed on my Core 2 Duo Lenovo laptop and it is serviceable, but I am sure it would run better on a quad core system.

At this fantastic price though, you are getting basic video editing/uploading software, that allows you to import videos from a variety of sources.  You won't find top-end features in it, but most consumers don't need to edit a 2 hour film.  Most are just editing and uploading home movies.

X4 is out now.  I understand x4 fixes a lot of bugs and slowness that some people have experienced with this product.
