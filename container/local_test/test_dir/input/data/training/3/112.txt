I was thrilled to see Amazon present these, as I had wanted the Rosetta Stone version for years. Since I never used Rosetta stone, I can't compare, but I will say this was fun, but only for a few weeks. After the newness wears off, it didn't seem much different than the memorization needed by other types of language programs. Still, a  very inexpensive way to try a language out.
