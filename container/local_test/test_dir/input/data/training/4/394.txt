CD burning is becoming a way of life, much the same way that audio CDs did. In order to make the best use of your CD-RW drive, however, you must have good software that will transfer your files or music onto the CD. Easy CD Creator 5 will do that and much more. Using this software, you will be able to easily create music and data CDs, record music from non-digital sources (tapes, records, and even the radio), create labels, and backup your computer. DirectCD will even allow you to use your CD-RW drive much the same way as you would a floppy. Just drag your files over, or save them from within your favorite application. This software is compatible with Windows XP (although you will need to download a patch, which is simple to install). If you will just be using your CD-RW drive for basic functions, then the software that came with your drive should work fine. If you want to make the most use out of that drive, buy Easy CD Creator 5!

If you are not running Windows XP (or plan to run), save your money. This version is very similar to 4.0 Deluxe, and you will notice very few improvements over your version!
