It has been installed 6 times & the 2nd day will not open. I have called or chat with them & I am hooked up with someone over seas that does not fix it. I have asked for a USA phone number & they will not give it to me. I have had NORTON for over 10 years & this year they will not give you a disk, they down load it.. This has been going on for over 2 months. I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK SO I CAN GET SOMETHING THAT WORKS.
