I love the maps and all you can do with them, as the packaging says you don't need a GPS (but you need a Tablet or Laptop) and the detail, points of interest are excellent. I plan to use this software for a road trip to central Florida (from deep south Texas) in July. While I WILL be using my GPS, there will be time for stops here and there and we plan to spend a least one night on the way at a yet-to be-chosen point.
My criticisms of this software is that it is almost exactly the same as 2010; really! there's so little difference. Asides from that, I plan to take my Android Tablet on the road trip for use in the vehicle and...this won't work on it! Unless they come up with a cloud based version (I am not aware of one if there currently is) I will have to also take a Windows based laptop.
I honestly think that though the maps are second to none, the packaging is stale and needs to be brought up to date!
I do recommend it because it is very good at what it is designed to do and people that plan trips ahead of time will love it but  the lack of compatibility with Android and I/phone/Ipad is a serious flaw.....
