I have to admit that I come into this with a bit of bias, I have been a Mac user for over 20 years.  Now that Macs are able to run Windows on the same hardware I thought I would be worth it to give it a shot.

I can't say if this is an improvement as compared to previous versions of Windows, but what I can say is that from the short time I spent with this OS I would not be inclined to switch to Vista as my main operating system.  It has nice graphics and was not at all terribly difficult to install but it just isn't doing for me.

I'll be back in a few weeks with a more in depth review, but you know what they say, "First impressions mean a lot."
