To be honest, I am still having quite a time figuring out how to do things on this software.  There is a built in tutorial but it is not the clearest or the greatest.  As far as loading the product is went very smooth and I had no issues, I am running windows 10.  I did use the photo enhancement part and it works very well.  I played with some photos and made myself look about 10 years younger.  Most of these types of products have a learning curve and this one is no exception.  I had Nero before and it worked good after one figures out all the various functions and I am sure this will be the same.  Persons that are more tech savvy will likely have no problems with using this.  Overall seems like a good product.
