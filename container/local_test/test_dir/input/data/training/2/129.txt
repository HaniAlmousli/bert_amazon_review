Stay Tuned for Danger is the follow-up Nancy Drew game to the award-winning Secrets Can Kill. While Stay Tuned for Danger still leaves quite a lot to be desired, it definitely shows improvement in the overall quality of the Nancy Drew games. This is a step in the right direction.

This game takes place shortly after Secrets Can Kill. Famous soap opera star of "Light of Our Love" fame, Mattie Jensen, has caught ear of how Nancy solved her last case. Mattie calls Nancy's Aunt Eloise (who's coincidentally a friend of hers) to request that Nancy fly up to her apartment in New York City to solve a brand new case. Mattie's co-star, Rick Arlen, has been receiving death threats. Nobody knows who they're coming from, and despite the treats becoming more serious, Rick refuses to go to the police. It's now up to Nancy to go undercover as an extra on the set to find a would-be killer...

The plot is solid, and despite the age of this game, it remains one of the greatest plots I've ever seen in a Nancy Drew game. It has a very mature, dark, and frightening atmosphere. Even though this game doesn't deal with curses or ghostly haunts, the threats that Rick (and later, Nancy) receives from the culprit become very life-threatening and haunting in and of themselves.

The quality of the game leaves a lot to be desired, but it's a big step up from Secrets Can Kill. Thankfully there is no longer any need to switch between discs. The controls still lack user friendliness, but they have improved slightly (now there is no longer need to scroll up and down through the environment as well as left to right). There are also more puzzles, some of them holding on to the quality level that the modern games have.

Sadly, it's very easy to run into glitches and have to start the game over. It's easy to miss important items that Nancy must pick up to solve the case, and therefore requires the player to start the game over again or wait a long period of time doing nothing until finally being able to get where Nancy needs to be to pick up the item. This is my biggest complaint about the game, as this makes it very frustrating for the player if he/she runs into these setbacks.

The graphics are still weak, but they've improved significantly. The characters are now 3D like the environments. They look more like Barbie dolls than actual people, but it's much better than having them look like 2D cartoons. The environmental graphics are of mostly the same quality as the first game, but that isn't a very bad thing (especially considering the age of this game).

The characters in this game probably rank among the best casts in a Nancy Drew game yet. There are SO many characters in the game (six suspects, with eleven characters playing a part of the story). The suspects include Mattie Jensen, who might be using Nancy to throw suspicion off of herself, Rick Arlen, who might be behind the threats to gain publicity, Dwayne Powers, Mattie's agent (formerly Rick's too) who is jealous of Rick's success, Millie Strathorn, the eccentric old lady who owns the WWB Network (the studio where "Light of Our Love" is recorded) and has a hard time differentiating truth from reality, Bill Pappas, the unseen producer of the show, and Lillian Weiss, the angry and bitter director of "Light of Our Love". There are also two characters who play roles in the story, but aren't interactive "suspects". These include Ralph Guardino, who is the security guard of WWB but can never really be questioned as a suspect, and Owen Spayder, an unseen stagehand who seems to have a larger role in the story later on. Nancy's best friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne and her boyfriend Ned Nickerson can still be called for help like in the first game, but they're also able to be conversed with about her case and even provide insight into the case itself.

The music in the game is also well done. I prefer the Secrets Can Kill soundtrack, but the soundtrack heard in this game is also very enjoyable. It held on to the perfect "New York City" feel while leaving off an atmosphere of mystery. The music heard while sneaking into the studio at night made the place all the more eerie, while the music heard while exploring Mattie's apartment during the day was rather upbeat. I'd say that the soundtrack was perfect.

While Stay Tuned for Danger remains a bit of a sub-par game, it's a drastic improvement compared to its predecessor. If you've played this and are considering giving up of the Nancy Drew games, please don't do so yet. Starting with Message in a Haunted Mansion, the Nancy Drew games really do get better from here on out, and Stay Tuned for Danger does tell an awesome story that's worth experiencing. I'm hoping that a re-release of this game is issued (like the one they did with Secrets Can Kill, but staying more true to the original this time), because it could use some improvements and the original isn't compatible with computers more advanced than Windows XP. Those who started playing the Nancy Drew games later on deserve to experience the first two games, and the first two games also deserve better quality. So, here's to hoping for Stay Tuned for Danger Remastered!
