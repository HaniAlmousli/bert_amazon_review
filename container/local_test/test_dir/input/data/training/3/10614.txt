What is the difference between VideoStudio Ultimate X8 versus Pro X8 (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corel-VideoStudio-Pro-X8/dp/B00T0I6J9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corel VideoStudio Pro X8</a>)?  Other than that Ultimate X8 is currently only $5 more than Pro X8?  According to Corel's feature comparison, the only difference is that Ultimate X8 includes the Premium Special Effects Pack. There are 10 features in this Ultimate pack, only 2 of which are new and 8 were included in VideoStudio X7 Ultimate. The two new special effects pack are: 1) proDAD Adorage Starter Pack - Create high-quality trailers, credits and more with 150+ effects and transitions; and 2) NewBlue FX Essentials IV - Solve everyday production problems with dozens of image-enhancing presets. Turn day into night, create reflections, touch up skin and more. The other 8 are Boris Graffiti 6 (titles and effects), NewBlue FX Motion Effects, NewBlue Background Generator, NewBlue ColorFast, proDAD Mercalli SE (for image correction and stabilization), proDAD VitaScene LE, proDAD Handscript animation, and proDAD RotoPen (animated pen effects).

What's new in VideoStudio X8 (both Ultimate and Pro)? Corel lists 13 new features such as XAVC S support for resolutions up to 4K, easy freeze frames, conversion of titles to alpha channel files, more overlay capabilities, a library of ScoreFitter royalty-free music, and more. There are also five enhanced features such as enhanced motion tracking, enhanced screen capture with audio, and enhanced 4k hardware acceleration for 5th generation Intel processors, plus support for MKV files and export support for MOV (H.264 format) videos.

The X8 interface looks like the VideoStudio versions back to X4 (maybe earlier) and is also similar to other video editors. VideoStudio has three main tabs at the top: Capture, Edit, and Share.  Capture is for importing or capturing video files to work with.  Share lets you save your video files to your computer, the web, DVDs, or devices such as phones and tablets. (There is also an option to create a 3D video.) The program starts up on the Edit tab. The top left section of the Edit tab is the preview panel that displays your video; the top right section is the library of files, filters, transitions, etc; and the bottom is the timeline and tracks where perform your edits (there are 2 views: storyboard and timeline).

In my opinion the open/import features are not user-friendly. There is a File menu but no File | Open command to open a single video file. But if you keep looking you'll find the Insert Media File command. Using the Capture tab, when you double click on a folder it opens a folder tree for you to select the folder(s) of interest.  Then you click Start and then VideoStudio should show you icons of the video files in those folders.  You can then select the ones you wish to import into your VideoStudio library. The first time I saw this I couldn't figure out how to select a file to import. I finally found out there is a tiny gray box in the top left corner of each file icon that you have to click to select. I again had trouble with VideoStudio refusing to show me the files in the My Videos folder. When I selected that folder VideoStudio gives me an error message, "There is no valid content" even there are more than 600 videos in that folder. So I selected my Roxio folder and again got the "no valid content" error even though there are only about 20 avi, mpg, mp4, and wmv videos there. Then I selected 2 subfolders under My Videos and clicked Start, I got an error message that "VideoStudio has stopped working."  Oh well. I contacted Support about a fix and they said to just use the Insert Media command. You can also drag a video file from your file manager and drop it onto the first track (the video track) on the Edit tab. However I was not able to drag and drop my avi files there. Bummer.

The learning curve can be steep. The best place to start is probably the Quick Start guide. You can access it from the Help menu at the top left corner of the window. There are also some video tutorials on the Corel website that you can get to by clicking Video Tutorials on the Help menu.  Unfortunately the organization of the tutorials is bad and most of the tutorials won't help a beginner get started.  I think Corel wants you to purchase some of their training products.  If you get frustrated you can go to Youtube and search for Videostudio x8 tutorial, but there are about 1,500 results.  Another option is to read the 300 page user guide.

As a test I imported a 2 hour High Definition video that is 1920x1080 resolution and 2.3 GB in size.  I did a few edits and then exported it. VideoStudio was able to do that without a problem. I found it easy to do effects like freeze frame, slow motion, and time lapse.

VideoStudio X8 is a very powerful program.  The trick is learning how to use that power and getting past the few bugs.
