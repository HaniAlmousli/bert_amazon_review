Wow. A lot when into the making of this program. A lot of care and attention to detail went into every aspect of this great resource. Previous reviewers give a great overview of what this software is about so I'm not going to munch on the same cud. I can say they are spot-on. The perspective I can give is that I work with kids every day. This hits them right where they are at. Although the repetitive noises and phrases may drive adults nuts, kids actually enjoy and need repetition. Take a clue from Teletubbies. They need the repetitive predictability in order to learn. That's all part of brain development. There are so many things about this that shows the creators really knew what they were doing and had a great grasp on child developmental stages and learning styles and theory.

One thing other reviewers do not mention is the price. This is very expensive and it's subscription based. You get the first year free. Is it worth the price? Honestly, I can't make that judgement for you. But I can tell you that the level of quality is very high. I can also tell you that not only do my kids love it, they seem to resonate with it. Albeit, I've only had this a few days I'm fairly certain that with the amount of activities you get with this your kids won't get bored. I've been in education for 33+ years and I've got a pretty good sense for stuff like this. I think this is a winner.
