When WinXP came out I refused to abandon my reliable Win98SE until SP2 was released and WinXP finally became an operating system (from the experimental eye-candy it first was). Experts advise us to do the same with WinVISTA - yet I do not think this is ever gonna happen...

WinVISTA is far WORSE than the initial release of WinXP: NUMEROUS and MAJOR compatibility problems with most third-party Software, Games (well, all games except...HALO2), GFX-Cards, Scanners & Printers, Cameras & USB-Peripherals. Not to mention Microsoft Software!

Even MICROSOFT Software (such as STREETS & TRIPS 2007, ENCARTA 2007, PICTURE-IT or MONEY 2007) refuses to work with WinVISTA! If they did not care to support their own Software, why should anyone else! And all this trouble just for the cool Aero effect (which, by the way, may be NOT supported on your 2007 PC!) and DirectX10 (for which, you do know, there is not one affordable GFX-card compatible with?)?
I don't think so!

Windows is an OPERATING SYSTEM! Why is it pretending to be able to DO EVERYTHING? It canNOT! Sure, it is nice to be able to listen to music, burn CDs, browse the Internet.  But that is why there are so many Specialized Software available! And, what is even worse, WinVISTA will not let exactly these Software titles function as intended!

Now, this is the UPGRADE edition - which means it is to be installed not on a freshly formated disk but over a pre-existing Windows edition. Read reviews in ANY forum: this is the WORST possible scenario in aspect of software compatibility and hardware drivers.

I had WinVISTA on my Laptop for about a week. I could not format quick enough! There is NOTHING WRONG with my WinXP-SP2. WHY CHANGE THEM?
