I wouldn't normally suggest this but do not upgrade!  Vista takes the only good thing about Microsoft products - which is the advantage of an interface that you already know - and breaks it.  Vista really is different than any of the previous versions of windows but in the worst of ways.  Here's a typical example.  Want to do something simple like search for a file?  Too bad!  They have a much faster version of search with just one problem - no place to enter the search criteria.  Overall I think that the only people who have gained from Vista are Apple and Linux users since there should be more defections with the Vista fiasco.
