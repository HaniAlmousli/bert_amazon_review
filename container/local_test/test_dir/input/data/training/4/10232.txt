For home projects and web video capturing (non-YouTube), Creator 13 is decent enough to get most tasks done. I do video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro CC so I wasn't expecting a huge amount of features, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how much WAS offered when in Advanced Editing Mode... the library has quite a decent set of transitions, overlays, text editing and control of background music. Obviously there are pro features missing (such as shaping the envelope of a transition) but honestly, you can produce quite good output with the NLE. The output options are numerous too, where you can either pick a specific resolution (720, 1080) or simply pick the device that your project is intended for.

I tested the "Create video from webpage function and it does work. The utility windows shows what video it's capturing from the webpage you are playing it on. However, bad news and this isn't Roxio's fault: it doesn't work with YouTube. YT constantly changes where temp video is staged while its playing plus they hide it deeper and deeper every month it seems. So this software won't capture YT but not many can.

The real power of Creator 13 is the media handling... you have every option to burn and copy DVDs and CDs including options to write the image to the hard drive first for more stable data (always check that box) as well as verify the disc afterwards (always do that too, although it adds time). You can open ISos and burn them right to disc, make data discs and assemble and produce audio CDs. This module alone is worth its price, not many utilities give you all of the options for  data and media handling.

Not So Good: format conversion. I took an .MP4 of a music video that was in 1080p and told Creator to convert it to iPhone 6 Plus format. When I previewed the new file the audio was out of sync. That may not happen for every format, but it'd take quite a while to test every conversion format. Since I have Adobe Media Encoder I'll use that, but for the general audience who doesn't subscribe to the Adobe tools, I'd look elsewhere for video conversion. Apple Quicktime Pro is a good start.

For the money it's a pretty good package, the file and disc handling and the web capture are the redeeming features. The Free Movie Maker on Windows along with QuickTime Pro would handle media creation and conversion but you wouldn't have the disc authoring ability (Menu page on a DVD for instance) nor the disc features, so as an all-in-one solution that won;t break the bank, this one is working well on my Windows 8.1 PC (i3 running on an SSD and 16GB ram).
