Webroot reminds me of AVG, but is a bit more streamlined. It does it's work in the background, and seems to do it
very well. I have been a life long Norton user ever since I learned PC-Dos (not ms-dos) from Peter Nortons book (I still have it).
Over the past few years I have been getting more and more frustrated with Norton, and did not totally trust AVG, as it was a bit twitchy.
So far I am pleased with Webroot after dumping Norton antivirus which was becoming too much work.  Windows platforms are hard enough
to maintain without having to deal with antivirus software that you constantly have to update and scan, and comes in to load the latest version, that then asks you to send money when your existing version still has over 300 days to go.
When doing web searches, Webroot will mark each with trusted, questionable, or no markings to let you know whether or not to go there.
Webroot works in the background, and will always come up when you first start your computer to let you know it is working.
After many tries to get an answer from webroot, the people on Amazon finally came up with what I asked: YOU CAN USE ANY UN-USED CD IN ANY YEAR which is much like Norton.
At under $20.00 for 3 PC's, I really can't find a better deal/software, and at this price, what is stopping you from giving it a try.
Addendum: Had a malware attack a couple of days ago and had to do a system restore,  as it would not let me open any of my programs. It has also become more and more unstable as I get within two weeks of subscription renewal; coincidence, I DON'T THINK SO.
