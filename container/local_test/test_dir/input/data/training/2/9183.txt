WordPerfect was my word processor of choice in the days of DOS. It was slow to make the transition to Windows and seems to have never quite made it. Everything from inserting a photo to printing is "configured" showing that it does not conform to Windows protocols. Years later it looks and behaves almost identically to its original Windows version. It does not seamlessly import Word documents, especially those including graphics. As for the "Reveal Codes" feature, it is a menu choice in Word implemented with a click of the mouse. My wife likes WordPerfect and uses it daily.  Quattro Pro is not an original WordPerfect application and is well suited to Windows. It readily imports Excel documents. The original spreadsheet companion to WordPerfect was PlanPerfect which, for some reason, was discontinued years ago. I have no need for Presentations and have not used it so cannot comment.
