If you are still using Office 2007 or older then this is a upgrade to consider but there are a few issues with this version of office. The installer seems to run in silent mode so you may find yourself trying to run the installer more than once.  Also, when applications start up they are SUPER SLOW.  Probably because they are connecting to the web.  Bit it can be annoying.

There are a lot of usability tweaks that make this much easier.  A lot of the bigger software company's including Microsoft are moving to a Monthly/Yearly subscription licensing model.  So this may be the last version of Office you can buy outright.  Other than being able to edit PDF files, there aren't a lot of compelling reasons to upgrade from Office 2010. If you are considering buying this for your kids to use for school I think it's a decent investment because they will probably use this software once they get to College and the workforce.
