I got this product since I was moving cross country and wanted to use a quicken product without parallels.  While the interface is easy to use and I enjoy its simplicity for not complex transactions, it consistently had problems hooking up to my bank as compared to Quicken for Windows.  I also did not like that there is no feature to auto-reconcile.
