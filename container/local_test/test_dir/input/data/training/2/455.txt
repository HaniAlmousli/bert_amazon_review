For the average web surfer XP is a big step up from WinME.  If you just wanna surf the net, use Office applications, and do basic things, XP is the only upgrade to consider from Win95 or Win98.  XP Home (like Win ME) still lacks basic functionality if you want to do database to website connectivity that was present in 95 and 98.  For that you have to go to XP Pro.  You can work around it in XP Home, but shouldn't have to.  Salespeople don't seem to know this, so tread carefully when buying an OS if you are looking for this functionality.
An upgrade to XP may send you on a time consuming, frustrating, chase to upgrade your hardware drivers and software programs.  You may find that you have to shell out $$$ just to keep the same programs working before and after the upgrade.  I bought a system from Gateway, which came with an upgrade to XP.  With the upgrade installed, the CD creator software that came with the machine doesn't work and an upgrade is almost $100.00.  There are other things like a relatively new scanner that still does not work yet.
The interface is different from previous versions, and makes you feel like you are in the middle of Super Mario Land.
XP Home is more stable than previous versions, but it may require a bigger $$$ outlay for other things to keep it all working.
Bottom line in this case was another $200.00 spent on XP PRO to get what I needed.  Anyone want to play Monopoly?
