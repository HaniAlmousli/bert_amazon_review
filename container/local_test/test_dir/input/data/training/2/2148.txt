In reading the comments I find no mention of "Royalty Free".

This is down in the "You are not permitted To: " paragraph, second sentence of the first paragraph. Check the disk license.

The images on the delivered disk "Use any of the photos of clip art images for any COMMERCIAL PURPOSE".

These are not "Royalty Free". The subscription graphics are.

Most of the STUFF is  low resolution, unidentified and unidentifiable graphics. Due to this and the royalty restriction I am deleting all of the graphics on the delivered disk from my computer.

The one saving feature is the one year iClipart subscription.
Lotsa good photo objects there most of which can be converted to true "photo objects" for use in home or commercial graphics (giving them an alpha channel).

I have looked at "Photos", food and drink and nature/scenic. F&D consist mostly of what appear to be cropped photos.

N/S- many are not suitable for tv graphic productions.

Loads of cartoons!! and not bad.
