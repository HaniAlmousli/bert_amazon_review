If Microsoft and Apple are going to force us to buy Word, can't they at least make the program work without being so damn buggy? Word's persistently bossy auto-formating and general kloodgy bugginess has been going on for years and years -- why is this still the case?? These people are making gazillions of dollars off this stuff, so why can't they get the basics right and stop driving customers batty?

Also, this version has too many bells and whistles. If you just want a simple word processing program, the rest of Word's shiny goo-gaws can be really irritating. It should be much easier for users to turn off any unwanted features -- software engineers may be in love with their own designs, but that doesn't mean the average user will be, too.
