I only use windows xp when Im in my ofice as the company runs on XP.....god help us all.  I bring my macbook pro to work with Mac Office on it and I get more work done saved secure than anything on the Dell Latitude with XP.  Thus far the Latitude sporting XP Pro has lost important documents on me on a regular basis, crashes to many times to count, freezes regularly, is slow as hell, slower to boot up, the mouse drivers/trackpad drivers screw up on a regular basis leaving me without a mouse unless I restart and it doesn't freeze.  I work at large oil companies a lot and I cannot belive they run their process on this crippled, dated, bug ridden, virus laced piece of junk OS.  XP sucks folks, Vista is just as bad and Windows 7 is Vista with a new coat of paint.  If you want a good secure, fast, easy, reliable system use a mac with OSX.  I know you have heard that already and I too was a sceptic for years until I bought a mac and tried it out when Vista and my Compaq presario died a few years back 3 months out of the box.  If you want windows to run stable run it inside a virtual machine or dual boot with mac, it's proven to run better than on any PC due to the cheap hardware used in pc's these days by HP, Compaq, Dell, Acer.  Oh look as I was typing this review on my Macbook Pro the Dell running XP Pro just froze again on start up, shutdown/restart will not work, the keyboard/mouse doesn't respond, I guess I need to remove the battery again.  What a great OS.......garbage.
