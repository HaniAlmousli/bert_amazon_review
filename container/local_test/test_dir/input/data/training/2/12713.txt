Disappointed with this version of Turbo Tax, and had to end up going to a tax professional to have my return done. Why would I need to spend $40 for the deluxe version of Turbo Tax in order to get my tax return done? I think Turbo Tax needs to be upfront about what features you'll get with the basic versus the deluxe. I always use the 1040EZ to file my taxes.  I'd rather spend the extra couple of dollars to get the features included with the deluxe version than waste money. Luckily, I got this software to try out.
