Having used Quicken in the various encarnations, I will say that I like the product.  Why give it a poor rating you say?  My main issue with quicken is that the product is great until you get to the end of life which is usually 2 to 3 yrs and then most of the functionality of it becomes useless, which in fact, forces you to upgrade.

Quicken 2013 seems to be very buggy as well and has had 10 updates since its initial release.  One I found right away was trying to convert a graph to a pdf file to save, that is buggy at best and doesnt appear to work properly.  As long as this program has been around you would think that the bugs have been worked out by now.

Utilize online banking, its cheaper and does most of what this does these days anyways.
