For those that are not quite understanding what this product is: it is a subscription to Office so that you will always have the latest version. You will have to fork out for it every year or be unable to use it. If you're a mover and shaker that needs to be up to date all the time then this might offer a good value for you. Bear in mind that the personal edition only gives you access on 1 PC and 1 tablet. Mobile is additional.

It is a rare household these days that is confined to such limitations. My household contains no less than 4 computers and several tablets at any given time. At a price tag ranging between $50 and $70 per year I can't be enthused about recommending this product. If you absolutely need the latest version of Office every year then I would suggest looking at the Home subscription instead. For myself, we will continue with the non-subscription version and upgrade every 2-3 years if needed.
