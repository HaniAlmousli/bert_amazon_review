I am disappointedin the direction Intuit has taken with the most recent round of products.
Rather than "Deluxe" offering you all of the forms and interviews you would require, the word "Deluxe" now just seems to be a differentiating brand on the packaging. In other words, Deluxe in the context of the description on the box doesn't mean what Webster's Dictionary says it means.

This will be the parting of ways for Intuit and my family. If you buy the Deluxe version, rather than being Deluxe it is going to wait for you to need a form that they say are not typical and offer you a chance to buy the forms and interview required to complete your taxes. I suppose that those extra interviews will make your version "More Deluxe". Maybe "Super Deluxe".

deluxe also de luxe  (d-lks, -looks)
adj.
Particularly elegant, luxurious, or elaborate for its kind; of superior quality or refinement: deluxe accommodations; a de luxe automobile; a hamburger deluxe.

Nope.
