I have the previous version of WillMaker and decided to try out the new one when offered the opportunity to do so. I have not taken advantage of the free Living Trust option and otherwise, I do not feel as though this update is an improvement over the previous version.

Overall, my opinion of WillMaker is it is great for simple or basic wills. For others, it might be a good starting point on things you need to know and prepare for when putting your will together. I did like the POA forms which were included as well as a considerable number of others, many of which seemed out of place for a will making program, e.g. promissory note, security agreement, etc.
