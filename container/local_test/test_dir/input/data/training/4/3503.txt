Have Spanish version 3 level 1,2&3 installed on a Vista laptop and it works well. The program uses repetition of words matched to pictures to reinforce learning. I like the feature of being able to speak into the system to test your accent. The software will let you know if your accent matches what it believes is correct. The program starts off easy but quickly becomes harder as you move through the different lessons. The key thing to remember is that learning any language takes time and a lot of work. To think that you are just going to go through the program without a lot of effort and learn a language would be incorrect.

The program is very expensive but seems to work well and if you are interested in learning another language it is a valid option.
