I went to Best Buy to get a new computer. I stood there and tried out Windows 8 on different computers. I am a semi expert on Windows - I've owned a 95, 98, XP, Vista, and Windows 7. I have 7 computers in my household of 5 people, and I am a big fan of Windows and have studied up each one as it came out to know almost everything about it. I feel that Windows has greatly enriched and empowered my life the last fifteen years.

But I had a heck of a time with Windows 8. The store employee had to show me how to get started like I'm someone clueless about Windows. I greatly disliked the big squares on the screen. They are ugly, take up too much space, and has no reason to be there. A small file icon is all that's necessary. One of the computers were on with the wrong aspect ratio and I tried to fix it but couldn't find display settings even when I found the settings. Couldn't find the control panel. Couldn't do nothing. Windows Vista took a bit to get used to too, but at least it was beautiful with its brand new Aero effect. Windows 8 is just plumb ugly with nothing but big squares. I don't want a big sign of ebay on my screen, but even if I did, I don't need it that big.

Finally, I got so annoyed that I did not get a new computer but instead, went home and ordered online a desktop that has Windows 7.

My prediction: Microsoft has maxed out on Windows with Windows 7. They will never produce any better Windows than 7.

Note to self: Be satisfied with Windows 7 and never expect anything more from Microsoft.

I will post this comment on Amazon now and add to it 5 or 10 years later. If my prediction proves to be wrong (which would be great for everyone) I will admit that I am wrong in the above prediction. If I turn out to be right, I will gloat.

I wrote the above a year ago. A couple of months ago, I bought a new laptop directly from Dell. They still give the option of Windows 7 or Windows 8, and I chose 7 because my laptop does not have a touch screen.  Just so you know,even now, you can still buy a brand new Windows 7 computer if you want to. My new computer's aero effect looks so good, sometimes I just sit and admire it!

Funny story: A friend of mine recently went to Turkey and told me it was paradise on earth. He has a Windows 8 computer. I ask him to email me some pictures of the paradise, but he says he can't because he still hasn't figured out how to use Windows 8! I laughed when I heard him say that.

Another funny story: my son was telling his school friend on the phone how to do something simple on the computer. I heard him yell, "Just go to the Start button and choose control panel!" Then he yelled, "Why can't you find the Start button, it's right there on every computer!" So I had to interrupt to say that if his buddy has Windows 8 there is no Start button. My son's jaw dropped, then he screamed, and in the end, his friend still couldn't do the simple thing. It made me laugh, though.

One last thing: I just want to clarify this: I don't mind learning a totally different kind of Windows if it's better. I love computers and I love what's new and better, even if it has a steeper learning curve. But I don't like ugly. Windows 8 is ugly up front, and I will not give up the beautiful Windows 7 for something ugly!
