This is a slow and tedious way to learn a language and I am running on Win7 with an i7 processor and 8 gigs of memory so it is the program, not my machine. It slowly reads a lot of short old tired videos from the CD. The product appears to be a recycled jumble of mostly old language disks. Two are more modern and move at a reasonable pace. Some disks require installing programs such as Flash, and Quick Time. I don't like programs that use because Flash contains spy-ware (tracking) that you have to go to the Adobe website to disable. Some disks seem to repeat the material on others but in a different format. If I had demoed Instant Immersion first I never would have bought it.
