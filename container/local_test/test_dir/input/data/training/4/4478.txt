I upgraded to Paperport 12.1 in June, 2010, and must be one of a lucky few who find it works just fine.  It was first on a Windows 7 desktop and now I have it reinstalled on a Windows 7 64 bit laptop.  My comfort level with the program is to the point where I often use the desktop interface as an alternative to Windows Explorer.  Often, product feedback is dominated by the unhappy.  With my apologies to those of you who experienced problems, I am one happy user of Paperport.
