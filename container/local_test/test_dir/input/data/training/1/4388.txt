I was really hoping that this new product would be easy to use for a busy person like me. I just want a program that I can install and leave it alone.  It was very easy to load on my laptop, and runs fine on the laptop.  However, I have had big problems with the program on my desktop.  I can't get the virus scan to update at all. When I sought tech support, their suggested fixes did not work.  When I tried again, they still didn't work.  Now I don't know what to do. They did email me back within 24 hours; however, their literature suggests I call or email, but there is no phone number listed.  I was not able to correct the problem on my desktop.  I guess I'll have to load a different program on my desktop.  This one didn't work for me.
