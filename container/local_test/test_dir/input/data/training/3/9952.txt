By now you've likely seen a ton of negative reviews and/or comments noting that the makers of TurboTax have apparently gotten a little, well, greedy.  Features that used to exist in the Deluxe level now require upgrading to the Premiere level.  Depending on how much you complain you can probably find an inexpensive upgrade to get back the features you need, but in reality it seems that plenty of people got upset at having to pay more for what they used to get or having to complain to get those features back no matter what had to be done to do so.  I'm trying to be fair here in noting that for an average user, the features that were taken away from the Deluxe version of this software probably aren't needed, but average is a highly unpredictable thing and many people might find that they actually do need those missing features and now they are expected to pay more to get it or switch to a competing product.

Realistically both products won't see serious use from me for a few more weeks.  Once employers make the earnings statements available I'll get to spend serious time working on returns and determining the good or bad news about the tax situation for my family.  While I hope for good news in that area, I'm also hopeful that Intuit will yet again learn the lessons of not upsetting their customer base.  We'll see about that in future years though, assuming I continue to willing to give them a chance.

I would note that at least one competing product (the HR Block application, for example) seems to be making a serious push to take advantage of the possible mis-steps here by Intuit.  I can't say that I blame them as it surely seems to be a golden opportunity (some people might remember how "New Coke" helped Pepsi make inroads against their competition) handed to them.

I suppose I could have come here and chewed Intuit a new one like others have, plopping a one-star review here and just moving on but I'd prefer to be honest in my review and note the issues that I have with the product rather than just dog-piling on here.

I've been a user of TurboTax for many years now.  Long enough to remember more than just this current year's issues with the application and stupid things that Intuit has done.  (I remember a big fuss over the equivalent of a root-kit that was installed compliments of one year's version of the product.  Apparently current management doesn't remember that mistake as they make a similarly upsetting move with this year's product differences compared to last years :-/ )  Given this year's mis-steps, and some problems I had with last year's product, I'm not sure I would remain a TurboTax user.  I seriously had intended to switch to a competing product this year (that earlier mentioned HR Block software, already purchased as part of an Amazon Gold Box deal not so long ago).  I felt forced into using that product last year (and I did buy it last year) as I had issues with a never fixed 'bug' in last year's TurboTax software.  While last year's taxes were a little more complex for my family than a typical year, they shouldn't have been that confusing and yet last year TurboTax caused me a lot of grief with my state tax filings and in the end caused a serious delay in getting the refund I was due.

I hope this year's version is better in that area but won't know for sure until a few weeks from now when I have all of the required paperwork in hand.  Given that I have both the HR Block product for this year and the copy of this year's TurboTax product to double check things with, I am pretty sure I'll be able to e-file this season without issue as one product or another will work for me I'm sure.

I have installed both products and have a couple of thoughts about both that I'll put here.  Both products irritated me a bit as they both wanted my personal information for product registration and/or activation (HR Block wants an activation code to be entered).  Neither product was smart enough to actually look for last year's tax return files to grab my personal information from to pre-fill that information out.  Given that a few steps later in the process the applications both read last year's returns and import personal information from same it seems both could make a little more effort to save customers time in that area.  I can note that the Block product didn't ask the questions about what product I used last year and/or where I purchased my products from.  It really doesn't take long to complete the information but it bugs me that I have to sit and type in information that is there for the taking if the apps used a smarter process for starting up.
