I spent three hours helping a friend uninstall norton systemworks..He thought he could install this over norton nis2006 !!Wrong!! these programs aren't compatible with each other..Both have versions of noton anti-virus 2006.!!! you cant run both...They fought each other until he got a grey screen. Nothing worked!!! I had to perform a clean windows install,and installed norton 2005 antivirus and the 2005 norton firewall...Now all is well...? we have to wait 15 days to see if the registration fails...You install at your own risk...Upgrading is not always better...You be the judge of this.
