Awful...glad to be done with this. All the time I was getting warnings about malicious threats from Kaspersky, only to find out that it could not block or eliminate the malicious threat. It's kind of like hiring a policeman who let's all the criminals go by but tells you about all the criminal activity. Worthless!

Not to mention, Kaspersky is a Russian company and I frankly don't trust Russia and especially Putin. Remember all American and foreign reporters were spied on during the Winter Olympics in Russia, phone calls bugged, internet hacked, etc. I simply do not trust a company run by a mobster and thug.
