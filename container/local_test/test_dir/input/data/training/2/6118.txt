This is like an OEM version - only one installation and one activation. Forget about installing it on more than one computer like the disc/retail version. Also, forget about moving it to another computer and getting it activated again (legally anyway).

I'd stay away from this unless you are absolutely sure that you will only be installing it and activating it on one computer AND that you will never want to move it to another computer in the future. Otherwise, pay a little more and get the non-PKC version that lets you install it on a desktop and notebook computer and move the license to another computer if you ever need or want to.

For a little more money, the non-PKC version is a much better value for many.
