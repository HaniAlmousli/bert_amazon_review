Kindle is an average e-reader, especially if you are on Android.  There are many features in other readers.

UNFORTUNATELY, and this is the worst aspect of Kindle, is that it is a closed ecosystem.  By that I mean, you have to buy all your books that you want to read from Amazon.  There is no way to import ebooks that have been purchased from other sources, even if you convert them to the encrypted Kindle format.  I personally believe that once a book is purchased and downloaded, you should be able to do with it as you please (as long as you preserve the author's copyrites.  This really annoys me with Kindle and other products that do the same (e.g. TIVO).

There are workarounds, but they are cumbersome at best.  If you want to buy books from Amazon and have them imprisoned inside Kindle, then you will probably be okay with this product.  Frankly, this is one of the reasons I rarely buy books from Amazon.
