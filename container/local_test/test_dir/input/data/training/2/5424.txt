I understand that software is not always released fully bug free. Heck, I come from the whole of IBM PCs so I know that to be a fact. The problem for this software maker--Roxio is that Mac users expect better. They expect that when a program says it is going to do something, that it just works. The sad fact is that every time I used this software, some glitch got in my way of being happy about the outcome. I would always update the software before using it but while the bugs switched, they never fully went away. You are left feeling that you wasted money on an item that will never been truly usable. I used it 5 times before I uninstalled it to never use it again.

So I recommend using Toast version 10 or another product over this Toast 11. This toast is so burnt you never get the taste out of your mouth, no matter if you are a light user or a professional. If you do purchase it, plan to watch it like a hawk, update it and follow their forums.
