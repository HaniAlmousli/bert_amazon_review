Sure, it will get your taxes done, but you'll have to go through pages and pages of "offers" like credit cards and other add-on services from Intuit much like their flagship Quickbooks software.

Intuit, when are you going to stop these practices? We've already paid for the program, so why bombard us with ads?

The software itself is just not very intuitive.  All I wanted to see was the difference between filing jointly or married.  All it would take is a nice tab, but after googling around, I found that you're supposed to hit forms, then type in "what-if", then pick a scenario....how in the world is a user supposed to know this?

Garbage.
