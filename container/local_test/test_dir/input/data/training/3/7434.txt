First, why do these virus programs all want to try to install something you don't want.  In this case it's a toolbar and my daughter wasn't able to get the software installed without the toolbar.  Please, stop including these things!!!

Otherwise it is acceptable.  It was easy enough to install by my daughter without a single request for help so I consider that a good thing.  The software itself is nothing fantastic but nothing bad.  I think I like Norton 360 better but my daughter hasn't had any complaints and didn't even seem to notice it was there after installation.  Anyway, I knocked off a star because of the browser tool bar.
