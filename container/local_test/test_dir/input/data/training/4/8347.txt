Not a full feature by feature review, as the test subject (aka my 4 year old laptop) died in service to my reviewing this product.

BTW, I do not blame this product in any way, shape, or form, for the demise of my laptop, apparently my laptop was in pretty good working order, but unbeknownst to me, the CPU fan was on it's last legs. If I find any major issues with this product  after my laptop has been reanimated (zombie computer???) after a CPU fan transplant sometime in the, hopefully, not too distant future, I will update this review.

But for 3/4ths of it's regrettable too short life, my dear, sorta departed laptop just hummed along quite happily, kept safe from all the assorted nasty's out on the internet by it's ever faithful companion, Norton Internet Security. As a long time user off Norton Internet security, since 1994, I have not had any problems with any of the eight different computers in my household that I have used Norton's security products on. The last time that I ever experienced anything remotely like the scans slowing my computer down, was over 12 years ago. And I don't run high powered computers with tons of memory, so far the most memory I have had on any single computer has been  6 gigs, when I first starting using Norton, I believe I used to think having just one gig of memory on a computer would be something I get to see, right about the time I would start driving an "aerocar" like George Jetson. : )
