Finally, a sub $100.00 8 port switch/router/VPN/firewall with Stateful Packet Inspection and everything you need to get your SOHO safely connected to the Internet. There are other's out there, but nowhere near the features at this price range. Setup in place of an older Linksys HPRO200 router/firewall was about 10 minutes including wiring and cycling the cable modem.  Rule sets will take awhile longer, but should be nice once it's done with configuration backup and restore features.
