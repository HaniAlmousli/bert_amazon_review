I have a screaming fast computer. Raid 10 drives, I7 processor, Lots of fast memory. The only thing that runs slow on this computer is Quicken. And I run a lot of different software programs on this computer. Sure can't recommend this. I wish there was an alternative, but since there is no Microsoft Money, these jerks have an undeserved monopoly.
