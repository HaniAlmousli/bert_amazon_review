Corel Studio has the best preview of any product I've ever used for organizing digital photo files; that said, however, I really prefer the more powerful editing options of PhotoShop and end up using Corel to look at my photos, but Photoshop to edit them.

It's quite possible that the newer version of the software has improved on the editing options; if you're considering buying the older version of Corel Studio at a bargain price, however, unless you primarily want software for organizing and viewing your photos, you're probably better off shopping around for a used copy of Photoshop.
