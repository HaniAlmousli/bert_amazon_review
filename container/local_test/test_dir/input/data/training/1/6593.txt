Well after installing Windows 8 Pro upgrade I immediately came to the conclusion very quickly  I missed my Windows XP on my laptop as it is very user friendly . I felt like I had to take another College course to figure it out.

There was no instruction manuals of any kind came with the software on this upgrade version . If I could give the review a ZERO I would.
