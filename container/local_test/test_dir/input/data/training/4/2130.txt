I will be honest, I'm not a big MAC person. Yes, I have one, and yes I use it. But, my primary computer is Windows *gasp* Vista. Anyway, the one thing I missed using my Macbook was the Office program. So, I installed this version on the MAC, and within ten minutes I was able to open the documents I needed. The Interface is a bit different, but then again I'm not a big MAC guy, so maybe that's why. The functionality is there for anyone who needs basic Office stuff. I've read other reviews that it's missing some Power User features, but since I'm not a power user I don't know.

Bottom Line: If you have a MAC and need to do the basic Office stuff, then this product will give you what you need. If you are a Power User and want to do Expert type of stuff on Office, you should really compare all the versions and read all the reviews to make sure the product you buy will do what you need it to.
