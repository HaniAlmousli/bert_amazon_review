Tiger, OS X 10.4 is another leap forward in the O.S. arena and Apple, once again leads the way. (Features will surely be copied by that "other" OS vendor.)
IF you have a G4 or G5 Mac, Tiger is a definite. For compatible G3 systems, you may not find Tiger worthwhile.
New features and stability are once again the hallmarks of this Apple software gem.
Spotlight: A remarkably speedy context search tool. The little magnifying-glass icon at the top right of the menu bar brings up Spotlight quick search. Enter a word or phrase and instantly (once the index is built) files matching by name or content will be shown to you. When you first run your Mac using Tiger, it will automatically build a Spotlight index, which can take a few hours, depending on the number and size of the files on your disk(s). The speed at which Spotlight can find files is astounding. Even if you search for a word buried in an obscure location, Spotlight can find it.
Dashboard Widgets: These are mini-applications. Icons "float" above your desktop and are easily accessible. Such items as a desk clock, calendar, weather monitor and iTunes player are readily usable and hundreds more can be downloaded, both from Apple and third-parties.
RSS in Safari: Now Safari is RSS capable. You can "subscribe" to RSS feeds to get updates throughout the day from RSS providers. News services, weather and bargain web pages are just a few examples of providers. If an RSS feed is available, Safari will recognize this and place an RSS icon in the address bar, so you can click on it to easily access the RSS information from that site.
Tiger runs smoothly. You really need at least 512 MB of memory - a gig or more would be preferable. Once you get past the initial index creation by Spotlight, Tiger feels fast.
If you are upgrading, check with the vendors of the programs and peripherals (printers, scanners, etc.) you use to make sure these are ready for OS X 10.4. Many of the reported problems are caused by incompatibility.
If you are currently running Panther (OS X 10.3) and are undecided about upgrading, you should consider the feature list. There is no dramatic speed increase (other than Spotlight vs. Finder.) The latest update (10.4.2, as of this writing) is very stable. If you want the features, go for it, it is worthwhile. If not, you can probably hold off until OS X 10.5.
If you are running anything prior to OS X 10.3, this is the time to upgrade. You will notice the speed boost. Stability and feature richness are very apparent.
