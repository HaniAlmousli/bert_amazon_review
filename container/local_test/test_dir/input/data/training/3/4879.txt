This program does a good job of cleaning and protecting your pc. I say good, not great. It did not catch everything, because when I replaced this software with another version, it found some things that had obviously been on my computer while running this anti-virus software. I will say that it is easy to use and doesn't bog your computer down, which is a big plus for me.
