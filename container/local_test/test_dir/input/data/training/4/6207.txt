Installed fine and is easy to use. The only problem I had was the State portion (which this software includes 1 state return) wanted to charge me $39.95 to download my state program! I had to do a search on the Turbo Tax site to find a contact number. I called, waited about 10 minutes, explained the situation, was told it was a glitch with the retail version of the software and thankfully a code was able to be given to me to "unlock" my one free state program while in the software. Once I got that info then it was easy to finish as usual. Just so you know, if you purchased the Federal + State, then you are entitled to one state return for free so if the software prompts you to pay for your one state download, stop and contact intuit. The only charge should be $19.95 to e-file your one state return (if you choose to e-file it) and you can e-file your federal return for free.
