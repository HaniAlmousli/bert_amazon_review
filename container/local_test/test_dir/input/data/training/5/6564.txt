Other than the start button, It runs better than Windows 7, and Windows 7 ran real good.
I got the start button added back in thru a computer utility "Advanced system care 6" free edition. I use the start button only because of habit and I do find it a bit faster than the tiles in 8's start screen.  I am sure at some point I will outgrow it.

I did the upgrade option this time (from 7) and not a clean install as I usually have done.  I was surprised that it went very smooth and lost no data.  I did back up everything prior to the install. Only one program had to be reinstalled because of functioning. Saved a ton of time on reinstalling everything. The upgrade will even leave your desktop as you have it in 7.
Microsoft just keeps getting better at Windows upgrade process. This one is down to a science..

Windows 8 also cleaned up a problem I was having with IE 10 on 7 which MS upgraded and then updated. Flash player was not working after the update and print was scrambled on some parts of printed matter. I found the same problem on fire fox.

Boot time seems faster with Windows 8.

If you are hooked on the start button and refuse to upgrade because of this, Upgrade to 8 and install  the utility I mentioned (free edition) and have your "start button" and Windows 8 your way!

Windows 8 is a great upgrade and on the surface it is much the same as Windows 7 once you get the "start" button back in.
