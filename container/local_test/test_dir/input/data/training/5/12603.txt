More I use it, more I love it. I crop a lot of picture and this software goes strait to the point. I made some modifications on pictures and peoples where impressed. I did composite picture of my toddler running. The cons and the are nor enough for me to stop using the software is it's a little slow. There is no export to email. While you can export and email them. By the way it export really well pictures, to such a small file size that I can with outlook send about 75 pictures in one email. The original are 3mb and ended up exported at 200ko. People appreciate to have a bunch of them. Usually at 3mb I can only send 4 pictures. I don't know what adobe lightroom would do more that that, probably stuff I don't need.
