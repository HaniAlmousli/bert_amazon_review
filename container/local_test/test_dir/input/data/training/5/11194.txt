Great product that's reliable and easy to install.  This version added some extra cloud storage and other features.  It updates daily to make sure you have the latest virus definitions.  I've trusted my computers to Norton for years and the interface has been trimmed down to just show you the essentials--it's definitely a set it and forget it type of program that doesn't require much feedback from you to keep things running clean and up to date.  Everything can be set up to do it's thing when you're typically not using your computer.
