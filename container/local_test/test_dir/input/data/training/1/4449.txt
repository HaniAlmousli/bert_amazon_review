I bought this product after reading about AVG and its glowing reviews.  However, I had a problem with the install on my second computer.  The firewall simply would not install.  I tried the online fixes at AVG's Website but none of them worked.

I had to email "customer support," since apparently AVG is too cheap to provide a phone number.  Someone named Lakshmi, I am sure from India, emailed me back but his fix did not work.

I would recommend Trend Micro over this want-to-be anti-virus.  Trend has toll-free technical support and you get to speak with a live body, instead of being hung out to dry with second-rate support from India!
