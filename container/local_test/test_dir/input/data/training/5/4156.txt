This product was made exclusively for the Mac from the ground up, but with its slick black glossy interface palettes it looks like it is running on Vista.
Aside from that, this program is great! For those who think IPhoto is severely limited and don't want to spend what you need to spend for Photoshop, Pixelmator is a great alternative at such a low cost. For those who are familiar with the photoshop interface, you might find the one in Pixelmator eerily similar. You will notice the tools palette on the left and the layers on the right. I am an artist by no means, but I enjoy manipulating my photos with this program with ease. It has over 130 filters which you can see the results in real time before applying, great color correction tools, and it exports in a large variety of formats. You can even take a picture using your Isight camera and add it as a layer in your picture.

Like I said before, I am no artist, and this program is great for the average to advanced user who does not need everything that Photoshop has to offer. You can tell that the makers of this program did their homework and took full advantage of the best features of Photoshop and included here int his program at such a moderate price. For those who decide to eventually get Photoshop, Pixelmator is a great tutorial to practice on. Though the way some of the tools operate differ somewhat from photoshop such as the magic wand and the rubber band like tool used to adjust some of the filters the overall effect is the same and top notch.

I think this program is well worth the money, and hey you can try it before you buy it at the Pixelmator website, so don't take my word for it, try it yourself!
