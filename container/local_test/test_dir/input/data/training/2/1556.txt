and so when they mailed me the free software for my Mac, I decided to use it again. We have rental properties and when I started to input the information, the software quickly recommended upgrading to premium. Ok, so I did. Now, I have to ditch this whole return and buy Turbo Tax as well since it's screwed up my rental figures by applying "real estate professional" to one property only. It's mysteriously disallowed my depreciation.

The questions the program asks are lockstep and don't give enough straight forward help (like the other reviewer it was recommended that I read some lengthy IRS pamphlet- that's a great help-- thanks a lot!!) and it is difficult to know where it goes wrong in the interview. I think this software was rushed onto the market without enough testing. However, I'm sure that if your return is fairly simple and not 35 pgs long like mine, it works OK.
