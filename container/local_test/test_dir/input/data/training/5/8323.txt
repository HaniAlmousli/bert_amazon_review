I've been a user of Norton/Symantec products since Peter Norton had his picture on the box. Never had a problem with the products I used. At first Norton Anti virus and Norton Utilities then switched to NIS only. I've never tried Norton 360 and I'll let braver souls than I figure out why not.( cough-cough)
Remember, No program is going to make you 100% secure. But Norton at least makes you THINK you are and that is what really matters.. As long as you see that little green circle with the white check mark in it on your task bar I wouldn't worry much. But a word of caution, there are places where you can find trouble if you look for it. Nothing can prevent everything. So be careful where you surf and watch out because the really weird stuff happens when you look at seemingly harmless sites. Some song Lyric look  up sites come to mind.off hand. Use caution and Norton NIS will serve you very well.
One of the benefits of old age is that you don't have avoid temptation, it avoids you. It's  a great product, buy it you'll like it.
