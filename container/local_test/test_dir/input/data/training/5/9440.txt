I initially had some problems getting the program to install, but a fairly quick contact with customer service, they got me up and running and I was drawing.  I have an Intuos 5 Wacom tablet and some experience with drawing software.  I am fairly familiar with Photoshop and Manga Studio 5.  This program us neither of those things, although it is probably much closer to Manga Studio 5 if you are comparing it to something.

I set down with no instructions and no videos and was able to do a rough draft of angry birds in roughly 15 minutes,  Use is intuitive and straightforward. I was actually pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to start drawing with Sketchbook Pro 7

It is both powerful and easy to use all in one package. I would highly recommend Sketchbook Pro 7.
