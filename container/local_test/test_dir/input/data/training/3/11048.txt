Ever since Apple gave up on the DVD authoring market, there's been a need for good authoring software. Toast is adequate, and the interface is enough like iDVD to make the transition easy (assuming, of course, that you haven't changed over by now). Buuuut... that's about the only thing I'd buy it for.

The core function of CD/DVD burning is of course long obsolete. Roxio keeps it in there for historical reasons, I'm sure, but it's a little unlikely you'll ever need it for that. The audio and screencap tools are nice, although easily duplicated. The one thing about this package that actually bothers me is that two versions after I reviewed Toast 12, Blu-Ray capability is still DLC. This doesn't make sense to me; HD video is the norm now and has been for several years, so if Toast is the package you need, skip this version and go for Toast 14 Pro. It's *probably* worth the extra fifty bucks.
