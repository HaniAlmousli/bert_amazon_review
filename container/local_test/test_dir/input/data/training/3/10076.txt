For full disclosure, I should mention that I would never dream of using tax software to file the actual tax return, and even less to file an electronic return.  I prefer to use a reliable tax accountant, either an enrolled agent or a CPA.  So I use TurboTax just to make an estimate of my tax return. Then if my estimation differs considerably from my tax preparer,  I can check to see where I or she went wrong.
For that purpose TurboTax is useful but not great.  The forms demand far more detail than either the IRS  or my preparer would need, so I have to devise shortcuts to get the job done in a reasonable time.
