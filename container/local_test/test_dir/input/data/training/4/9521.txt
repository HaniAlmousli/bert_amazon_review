Don't buy "Ultimate".  I thought that "Face Filter" would be a nice bonus with the ultimate version.  I'm very disappointed with FaceFilter.  First of all it is a separate program, it is NOT integrated with PaintShop Pro.  FaceFilter is also the "standard" version not the "pro" version and thus you'll be frustrated and wanting the more expensive pro version.  The standard version lacks a *lot* of the overall features and basically is *only* for tweaking faces (and they should be more or less straight on angles) and is limited to 1920x1920 resolution (pro version can handle up to 6000x6000 pixel images).

PaintShop Pro X7 itself is a very well designed and capable photo editing program.  The only serious flaw I don't like is that often when I switch from "manage" to "Adjust" to "Edit" modes I end up losing my edits because it has switched me back to the original photo rather than the one I was editing in another mode!

Context sensitive help is very good. (Select a tool and over on the right it tells you a little about how to use that tool)  There is a steep learning curve to learn where to find the various tools and how to use them.  Once you understand them they generally work extremely well.
