I've now used VideoStudio x4, x5, & x6 and like them. VideoStudio x7 is no different. I've also used other video editing software like Cyberlink and Pinnacle and I'll say that the Corel products are probably the most user friendly, so if you're a beginner, this may be one to look into. Honestly, you can load this on your computer and figure it out within minutes without looking at any directions. At least I did.

Installation was self explanatory, the program has many different functions and effects. You can make fun or professional looking projects, any kind of format for any kind of media. You can add music, video or pictures and you can upload the video to your computer, burn a dvd, up send it straight to the internet, to Facebook, Youtube and the like.

I will say this, as I stated before, this is my fourth version of this software, and the there hasn't been much change with the effects that I've noticed, so for me that is a little disappointing. It would have been nice if they had added some new title, transition or video effects, but they are the same ones that have been there since x4 I believe. However, I still prefer some of them to Cyberlink, though I do prefer Cyberlink's title effects. I get a little frustrated with the title effects in Corel

I've also read other reviews from customers that have had trouble burning video to DVD. I've not done much of that, most of my videos go straight to internet, so I can't speak much to that.

The price is favorable to Cyberlink however, about $15-$20 cheaper.

If you're looking for something simple and user friendly with some fun effects, this is a good program. If you're looking for something with a little more pizazz, you may want to keep looking and/or maybe spend a little more money.
