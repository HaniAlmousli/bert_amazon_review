Years ago I owed what I think was the first version of this product and it didn't work very well.  This product however works really well.  The menus are a bit confusing but as far as tracking goes this is a good product.  I  used it while on a trip along side my Magellean GPS and it compared well.  The PC version is a little slower than the standalone GPS but it is a nice alternative to buying a more expensive GPS.  Another pro is you have a bigger view of the map and can zoom in and out.
