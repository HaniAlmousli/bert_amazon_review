Unless you really had a specific problem using the older version, I would probably recommend sticking with it.  While things have been reorganized (sometimes better) and potentially some bug fixes (though also new ones) ... I just find that the entire picture/pretty approach to navigation is really hard to use.  These programs (word and excel especially) have a vast set of complex features ... arranging them so that the user can "progressively discover" the more complex features is fine ... but this whole "dumbed down" approach that has been taken with the new version, for me at least, just makes it really hard to understand how to find anything.

Also, Microsoft recently announced details of its upcoming Office 2010 release, and there are MAJOR changes in store, including significant web-based functionality for free (like Google Docs), as well as very strong support for synching documents across Desktop, Web, and Mobile.  So potentially a strong reason to wait for the 2010 version.
