Not a good choice for most people.  Essentials only does allows basic functions and has very few "reports" available.

WORST feature - you cannot export QEM data files to any other financial software.  Intuit has allowed the data files to remain non-transferrable to IBank or to any Windows version.  They know the data cannot be exported and imported to other software and they do not care -- it must be part of their plan to keep customers.

SO BEWARE that if you buy QEM and use it for any length of time -- you will not be able (as of now) to import your data files in a useable form to any other financial software - such as IBank4 -- which is the financial software for a Mac that you should have used to begin with.  (The new IBank4 has many solid improvements and is a fully functioning financial software choice for Mac owners!&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ibank-4/dp/B003WT1KAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ibank 4</a>

QEM is very basic and a minimal financial program.  It is not for any one who has used and liked other Quicken software or 0Money or a previous version of IBank.

Essentials is very limited and limiting!!!
