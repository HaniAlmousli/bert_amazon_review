Quickbooks for Mac has come a long way since my last  and not-so-positive review of the 2010 version.

It's now stable, attractive and quite capable for many businesses.  If you have never used Quickbooks before,  give the Mac version a try for your business.  If your company deals with a single currency, is service-oriented, or if product-oriented has simple inventory needs, Quickbooks for Mac 2013 could fit your needs well.

My wife and I still use Quickbooks for Windows on our Macs for about a dozen companies by running the Windows version under&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Parallels-Desktop-8-for-Mac/dp/B008YTAKJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Parallels Desktop 8 for Mac</a>.  But, for several of these companies, Quickbooks for Mac is now a viable option.  It still lacks the full feature sets of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/QuickBooks-Pro-2013-Download/dp/B008S0IWNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">QuickBooks Pro 2013 [Download</a>], much less&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/QuickBooks-Accountant-2013-Download/dp/B008S0J1G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">QuickBooks Accountant 2013 [Download</a>], which is why most of the companies we work with will stay on the Windows version for now in spite of the additional complexity of running Parallels Desktop on our Macs.

Quickbooks for Mac 2013 permits batch invoicing (perfect for homeowner's associations and businesses that bill a group of clients a similar amount), payments via Intuit Payment Network (no monthly fee e-checks and credit card payments), and the ability to attach documents to transactions.  It supports up to 5 users on the same local network working in one company file at the same time (per-user licenses required), with user-permissions that limit what each person can see and do.  Since 2012, it has supported progress or phased invoices, useful for contractors and architects, for example.

QBMac still uses the floating window paradigm, one which Apple, Adobe and others are moving away from for Mac applications  (e.g., Aperture, Final Cut, iMovie, iPhoto, Photoshop, Dreamweaver), but it remembers the last location and size of each window, so you can create a working layout of activity windows that suits your needs - you'll just see whatever other application windows are behind these as with all old-style Mac apps.

The new Guide Me window automatically changes its content to reflect help and guidance for whatever you are doing, however many of the videos simply display "Work in Progress" when you click on them.  Some of those that do work have muddy sound and are compressed so much that you cannot read the screen text.

A personal thing due to my age:  Most program text in QBMac is quite small on my 27" Apple LED Cinema display which, as with most Apple laptops, has a higher pixels-per-inch PPI than older monitors.  I'd like to see Intuit give us the option of changing the type size, the size of which strains my aging eyes, even with special computer glasses.  It is the tiniest text of any program I work with.  (Palette text in some other programs is the same size - but not functional dialogs/windows.  My workaround is to drag QBMac onto an old secondary monitor that is 72 ppi.)  An exception to this is the left-column list of customer:jobs, vendors, etc in the Invoice, Enter Bills etc windows - this is extremely readable for me.  Registers, not so much.  I don't need any of Apple's 'Universal Access' features for anything else on my Mac, so adding 'zoom' or changing from non-native screen resolution just for QBMac is not something I'm willing to consider.

For the few companies I have that would work with the feature set of Quickbooks for Mac, there are still small things that will keep me on the Windows version... but only because it's already running on my Mac.  If I wasn't already set up with Quickbooks for Windows, I might force myself to live with these issues in Quickbooks for Mac:

1.  Consultants, attorneys, accountants, architects, graphics artists, etc. often like to record their time while the work is actually being done.  The QBWin Enter Single Activity window has a timer built-in.  It's so easy to start the timer and add additional notes as you work on a task.  If the phone rings, or you have to work on another task for a while, just stop that activity, to be returned to later, and start a new one for the phone call.  Etc.  When you return to an earlier activity, just start the timer again to continue on, adding additional notes and obtaining a total time entry for that one task which can later be transferred, with the notes (optional), as a single line to an invoice.  With QBMac, there is no built-in timer.  Instead, you must download the separate My Time application via the Customers > Time Tracking > Download My Time menu, and remember to refresh its lists every time you add or edit a customer:job or billable item (no dynamic linking to your company data).  My Time saves a separate time entry each time you pause it.  These entries can be merged when you export back into QBMac, but not with the same per-activity result as QBWin if you continue to add additional notes for what is intended as a single billable entry.  In general, I find having to launch a separate app (My Time) that requires management and export to keep the company file up to date an unnecessary additional level of complexity over time tracking within QBWin.  QBMac just needs to add a timer button to their Single Activity window, as has been requested for many years.

2.  QBMac now allows very long Notes fields for time and invoice entries, and thus is able to import that data from a QBWin file without data loss.  (QBMac 2010, e.g., truncated all imported notes and did not allow data entry of long notes.)  However, none of those fields expands to show the data or displays a scroll bar.  For example, in an invoice, only a single line is displayed - making it nearly impossible to edit a multi-line note.  You can only see the multiple lines if you switch to preview mode - but you cannot edit there.  (This contrasts with the Windows version which wraps the notes in the invoice, giving a live, editable preview.)

3.  QBMac doesn't work with Intuit's convenient GoPayment system unless you sign up for a merchant services account at a monthly fee.  For QBWin users, GoPayment is free of fees other than transaction fees.

4.  QBMac still only works with Intuit's online payroll, which starts at $25/month.  This $300 per year compares to the street price of about $50/year for the basic 3-employee payroll for QBWin.  One company we have has a single part-time employee with under $4,000/year in wages.  The $300/year Intuit fee is just unreasonable for us.

5.  Column width cannot be changed in forms (Bills, Invoices, General Journal, etc) - and thus complete data cannot be read.  For example, if you have nested subaccounts, you'll have no idea what the actual account is by viewing one of these forms unless you click on the account control. Ditto customer:job if the customer name is long.  Dynamic column resizing (and remembering user preferences) is essential (and works in the Windows version).

Conversion of QBWin files to QBMac format improves each year, for those who are either migrating, or need to send their file back and forth to a bookkeeper or accountant on the other platform.  As always, it is important to know what things do convert and which things do not.  QBMac does not have a means of importing accountant changes or journal entries, and so if a file is sent to an accountant, the QBMac user must not do anything in their copy of the file until they receive the file back from the accountant/bookkeeper.  (This differs from the abilities of QBWin.)

Bottom line:  Quickbooks for Mac 2013 is a solid release that can address the bookkeeping needs of many types of small businesses.  Intuit offers a free trial, and I encourage you to download it to see if your business needs are met by the product.  For myself, as a Quickbooks for Windows user who wants to switch, Intuit needs to resolve the issues in this review before I would migrate.  Naturally, I also look forward to the day that the Mac product achieves feature-parity with the Windows product so that we can completely leave Windows behind.
