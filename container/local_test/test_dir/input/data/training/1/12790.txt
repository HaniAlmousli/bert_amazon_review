I have been a big supporter of Corel products -- VideoStudio and PaintShop Pro -- since their earliest versions. They generally do what the more expensive software does but more easily and with more user-friendly filters and frills. Despite their aiming recent versions more at the auto-generate projects for amateurs to create fancy projects quickly, the Corel software still offers the features and function the pros want to product videos and graphics.

BUT, the recent versions, including this one currently infesting my computers, have an added thrill: THEY COME WITH POPUP ADVERTISEMENTS!  Goodie. Now whatever I'm doing I get obnoxious, endless, impossible to remove Corel ads popping up over everything. Often they have no X in the corner to close them. There is no way to stop them. I'm a computer person from way back and I cannot stop these things. I've done everything I have found in setting to stop them in the software settings, including not permitting them from the original install, and they are still there.

Evil. Horrible. And Corel just lost a lifetime customer.
