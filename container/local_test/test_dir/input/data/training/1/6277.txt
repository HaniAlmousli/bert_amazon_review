This will give my experience with Fix-It Utilities Professional, which took place over about a week of using this program on our home network.  We have three computers:  (1) HP Pavilion Slimline desktop PC (mine); (2) HP Pavilion Entertainment notebook PC (my husband's); and (3) Dell Inspiron notebook PC (backup/auxiliary).  All three run Windows 7 Home Premium with Internet Explorer 9; the HPs had Kaspersky and the Dell had McAfee for virus protection.

Installation was fairly easy on the two computers running Kaspersky.  On the HP laptop, it mostly installed except for the malware/antivirus program, which it would not load until Kaspersky was disabled.  For my HP desktop, Fix-It loaded everything.  For the Dell PC running McAfee, we ended up uninstalling McAfee and installing Kaspersky first.  We did try to install Fix-It with McAfee disabled but still ran into problems, i.e., we simply could not install Fix-It at all with McAfee.  We were going to take McAfee off the Dell anyway.  Once we had Kaspersky loaded onto the Dell, it still took three hours to load Fix-It because we kept getting error messages saying that the program had stopped functioning.

I was not unfamiliar with this type of performance program, having run TuneUp Utilities for the previous year with no problems whatsoever.  Fix-It offers most of the same features as Tune-Up, including pc analyzer, registry repair, one-click pc maintenance, program optimizer, and browser acceleration.  The file shredding and lost data recovery functions were enhancements over TuneUp.  Ironically, Fix-It advertises the ability to stop "frustrating PC crashes."  Well, we did not have any PC crashes before installing Fix-It.  About three days after installing Fix-It, both my computer and my husband's started experiencing the "blue screen of death."  For those of you unfamiliar with this unpleasant phenomenon, the entire screen goes blue with writing to the effect that Windows has encountered an insurmountable error and is going to shut down.  All data in progress at that point is lost.

Over the next four or five days, both of the HP computers experienced several blue screens.  We have had these HP's for about three years, and prior to installing Fix-It, we literally had never had any blue screens on these computers. Both my husband and I have been using pcs for over 20 years and are fairly experienced, but we do not have the patience, much less the special expertise, to deal with constant blue screens and the potential damage they can do.  We therefore took Fix-It off all three computers.  Since uninstalling Fix-It, the blue screens have stopped.  In particular, uninstalling Fix-It from the Dell turned out to be a royal pain. Under these circumstances, I cannot recommend this program.
