Bought in Dec but by January the price was lowered by $20.  I like most others thought we were buying the same program we had bought for 20 plus years but found that some of the functions we were used to are not in this version and had to buy up to get what we used to get.  So the price is higher and the functions are fewer.  Will definitely change to another tax program for future years.
