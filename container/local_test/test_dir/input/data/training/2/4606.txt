I decided to finally do a good job of backing up my home computers and bought a QNAP TS-110 NAS and installed a Hitachi 2 TB drive.  I already had an external SATA drive which I increased in size to 2 TB also.  I have the system working well and can share folders and have mapped network drives between the computers and the NAS.  So it is time to install Ghost 15.0.

The installation works well but when I set up a backup I can't access the NAS shared folder for the back-up.  I keep getting a error: "Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more than one user name, are not allowed.".  It turns out that Ghost has to access the NAS using a user name that does not come from the PC being backed-up. I had to Un-Map all my network drives and reboot. I added a "Ghost" user name to the NAS (Nas-name) with its own password.  I made a new network drive Q: with the location \\Nas-name\username; Re-connect at log-on; CONNECT USING A DIFFERENT USER NAME The user name to make the connection was "Nas-name\Ghost" and the corresponding NAS password.  I then added the normal network drive connection Z: under the normal user name.

OK, I have found out how to do this after many hours when they could have provided some warning and instructions in probably 2-4 sentences.  The backup completes without any errors.

I now check that I can recover the drive using the Symantec Recovery Disk (SRB).  When the computer boots from the Ghost SRB it can't find the Windows network.  I worked hours searching the forums and trying differnt things.  The Norton technician also did a remote link for 1.5 hours and he still could not get it to function.

So I have a backup that can't be reloaded on a clean hard drive.  So I have succeded in doing nothing after 20 hours of work.

The program looks like it works well for a backup to an external SATA drive (why I gave it 2 stars instead of zero)but will not work to a NAS even though the documentation states that it can.
