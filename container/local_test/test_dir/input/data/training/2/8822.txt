I already had a bad experience with Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate and found it too difficult to use - it's no good for anyone other than someone who's an expert video editor.

I decided to give it a 2nd shot with Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus and could not even get the software to install. I tried several times, restarted my computer, etc. and the installation would not run. I saw others comment that they were able to install the software by doing it in pieces, but I wouldn't even know where to begin with that.

P.S. My computer does meet all the requirements listed on the box.
