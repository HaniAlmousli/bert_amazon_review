This software works with Mac or Windows or iOS devices and can be used by 5 users or 5 devices. It protects your logins and passwords by creating a secure private connection. Very important for those who conduct business in coffee shops, and regularly log on to secure sites in public. It accomplishes this task by creating a VPN and encrypting your connection and making it invisible on public networks, so spy software will not be able to track it. According to product literature it also protects you during app usage on your iOS devices. Of course, you can also use it at home for better encryption.

Although Norton says that it will not cause any slowdown in the bandwidth, I keep experiencing delays, especially on public networks. It's hard to tell what's causing it though as the public networks are public and there are multiple users logged on at any time. The software also starts automatically on Mac and Windows. For iOS you will have to turn on VPN protection in settings. Then go into Norton settings to make the privacy protection manual. That will allow you to manually enable VPN protection when you are on a public network, otherwise you will experience slow speeds on secure networks.

It's good to use some sort of privacy when logged on to public networks, but given the slow down I won't use it if I am just watching youtube or casual websurfing. I am already careful never to enter email passwords or bank passwords when I am on public WiFi and use my cellular network. So given the high cost of this product it has limited use for me.
