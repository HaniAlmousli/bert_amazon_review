Unlike many other companies, when you want to update toast you are faced with a time consuming process.

You must register the product (with your email address). Create an account. Log into that account. Download your update. Reinstall the software (on my most recent update I had to re-enter the CD license key)!

What a hassle!

If not for the difficult updating procedure this software could be rated 4 or 5 stars.
