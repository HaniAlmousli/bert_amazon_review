I have been using this program for years.  It takes appropriate data from the prior year so you don't have to refigure it.  This includes the names of sources of interest and dividends, names of recipients of charitable contributions and adjusted basis of IRAs.  Download of updates is fast.  Watch the price closely and you should be able to get it for around $30.
