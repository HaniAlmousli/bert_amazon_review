How does a company spend billions in research and come up with a desktop interface (Metro UI) this bad?  And then they have the unmitigated gaul to price it very high when others like Linux Mint and Mac OSX "Mavericks" are giving their OS away for free.

The latest MS operating system throws away almost everything you have learned over the last 20 years about controlling a  desktop.  You'll need to be completely retrained to use big, fat, ugly 2-D "tiles" and be constantly kept away from using a normal desktop "file/folder" system for organizing your stuff.

Heckavajob, Microsoft...  What's next?  A mandatory "BIG-TOE" controlled desktop interface?
