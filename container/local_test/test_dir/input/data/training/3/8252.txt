I bought this when it was offered at a special price and use it in a household with G Data Internet Security.  It is installed on a PC which is used by my wife who likes free games.  That said Norton 360 does not handle PUP (potentially unwanted programs) at all well.  I will also comment that Free Ride Games deserves a solid slap for delivering a host of unwanted programs.  Where the user has the opportunity to decline these programs the screens where you must accept or decline these programs are deceptive.  Just as a comment to how Symantec Systems (Norton) does business this software ultimately was purchased to replaced PC Tools Internet Security.  Symantec Systems bought PC tools and then took them off of the market forcing me to change the antivirus software on 6 computers in the family.  Folks with a long memory will remember that this is not the first time that Symantec has done this with good products.  360 is an older attempt at an antivirus, system tune-up, back-up software and I don't think it does anything well.  Norton offers another antivirus program and if you must use Norton - folks have good luck with them.  I would recommend that they have more dedicated antivirus offering and that prospective buyers should investigate that..
