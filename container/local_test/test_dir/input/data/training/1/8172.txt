I just tried to log into Identity Safe, which I have been using for months, and Norton no longer accepted my login.  I wasted time with Customer Service and I could not get Norton to send me a verification code to send to my mobile phone or email account.  Now I have to look up all my passwords manually.  This is why I just don't trust cloud computing.  Imagine if this happened to all your other information you have on the cloud!!!!!
