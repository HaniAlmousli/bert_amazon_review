Our family uses several software products to create digital art and anime. I thought Poser 9 sounded like a lot of fun.

I received this product to review from Amazon's Vine program free of charge before the product was released to the public. I followed all the instructions to activate the product in order to unlock it to use it. Despite putting the serial number in many times correctly the system rejected me and I was unable to start using it.

I contacted Smith Micro immediately. I copied and pasted the serial number so that what I submitted to them was exactly what I inputted. It took a week for their staff to get back to me by email and all they said was "that serial number is a working number".

Again I tried to activate the software and was rejected giving an error message about "serial number invalid".

I rate this product 1 Star = I Hate It because I was unable to get it to work at all and the staff was not helpful.

Smith Micro should have a customer service line to call and talk to a human live. Also when providing a product for reviewing, if it will not activate the company should provide another product to that reviewer so it can actually be product tested.
