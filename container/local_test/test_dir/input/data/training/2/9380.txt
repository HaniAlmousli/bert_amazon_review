I'm familiar with earlier version of Roxio Toast so was hoping this newest version would be something special. It's not. At least, not on my Mac running OS 10.6.8 which is supposed to be supported. Almost any requested action is sure to start the spinning beachball of eternal waiting, even with no other programs running.

Although Roxio is quick to suggest you can use this to copy DVDs and Blu-Rays, the print is considerably smaller that tells you that it won't work on protected disks whether you own them or not. However, after ripping a DVD with another program, you can use Toast to burn it to disk...of course, you can also do that in the Mac OS. But with Toast, you can compress large video files to fit more on a disk. The problem? The compression engine doesn't work all that well. I tried converting a video file to MKV format and the result was a file twice as big as my other compression program makes, but only about half the visual quality (it was basically unwatchable).

I tried capturing web video - a new feature - and it flat out didn't work for me. Toast prompts you to start playing a video in your browser, and it will appear in Toast's capture window if it's compatible. I couldn't find anything compatible (like, oh, Youtube). Again, maybe this is a problem with using an older OS - but if that's the case, Roxio should change its recommended specs.

I assume that Toast 12 can still be used to burn basic archival disks of data, but for this price it should do a lot more - or at least do it a lot better.  There are a lot of inexpensive programs out there which will do one or more of the functions Toast offers, and do it better. Toast is an "all in one" product for those people who don't want to sift through the other offerings, but what they gain in convenience they'll lose in actual usability. Personally, I'll be going back to my earlier version of Toast which works more smoothly.
