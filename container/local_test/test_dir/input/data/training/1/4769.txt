In this day and age, it's easier and better just to mirror your ENTIRE drive to another spare drive.  There's no need to have tape-backup style incrementals and such nonsense, which are resource intensive and prone to problems.  Many backup programs already support automatic scheduled mirroring but not true image.  You have to manually click away to do it.  Not good, and for commercial software this is really bad actually.
