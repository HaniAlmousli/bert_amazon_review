WARNING: Right now this is priced exactly the same as https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AC3ZAHW/ If you are like me, you might not be sure which one is the better product. It turns out that Ultimate is considerably better than Corel VideoStudio Pro X9. DON'T buy this version if the prices are the same. I don't know why they are both currently being sold for $79.99, or how long this situation will last, but I would be hacked if I paid ~$80 for this version and found that I could have purchased the same product with the ability to add more camera views and with a LOT of extra high quality editing tools included.

Moving on the the actual performance of this product. It is what I have been using to edit video since I can remember. We had VideoStudio X5 on our computer and upgraded from it. We have used many different versions over time. They haven't really changed all that much, which is to say that they are all pretty straightforward and easy to use - especially once you learn your way around the program and have invested some time in using the program.

It is very easy to add basic graphics, text overlays, and the usual stuff. Music is easily added and you can even toss a video in and let it make the video for you and it will often be good enough, or need only a little final editing. Which is pretty amazing, but most of the software out there does this too.

I find it very easy to use, and Corel has gotten much better recently when it comes to customer service. Something changed there... They also have some very good user-to-user resources if you google them and ask questions. Often fellow users would have answers before Corel.  But as I said, Corel has improved a lot lately.

There are some cons, almost but not quite knocking this down to four stars.

Occasionally, I have run into glitchy and stuttery operation. This usually happens when loading a video format that is older or natively designed so that it uses more processor power than other, more modern codecs.

/UPDATE:  After playing with version X9 some more, I am finding that it does load some of these files without having to use a conversion program first - that is a really big deal if you have any of these old cameras around, or need to work with video from these cameras.  This finding makes me rate the software a solid 5 stars! END UPDATE/ Second, I really expect that I should be able to load ANY video file that my computer can PLAY into this program and edit it, and have it convert quickly to something that is modern and easy to edit and use. But I've had to jump through hoops to use older codecs like Kodak Zi8 and Creative VADO sometimes.  I understand that part of the problem lies with the older cameras. But I really think this software should be mature enough now to make those things invisible.  We should be past the days of someone wanting to edit some video they found laying around on their old camera and having to research how to convert that video. If the computer can play it (it can) then this software (IMHO) should edit it.

Overall, I am a big fan of Corel. I have been using Paint Shop Pro since the days when it was shareware and JASC. When Corel took over the software, there were some hiccups, but they have done a lot of good things with it and that software, in my opinion, is every bit as good as Photoshop for most people and priced much more reasonably. I feel like VideoStudio is sort of the same deal with video editing software. A FAIRLY priced product that works really well for most people without having to take classes at their community college just to use it.

Overall, I highly recommend this software and in spite of its minor issues, it is a great way to edit just about any type of video. I will say, despite the "Pro" label, it is not pro software. It is really good home software, but if you are a pro you know that and are using specialized tools on specialized hardware. This is great for almost everyone else though.
