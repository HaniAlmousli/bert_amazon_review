i have 11 months and three weeks left on my 15 month subscription and the ENORMOUS popups are every day often several times a day. this issue began plaguing me last week. worst for me it totally disrupts my concentration, focus while working. there is no way to disable this other than to uninstall the product.

yesterday while working once again front and center one of their sales popups but this time it resulted in me losing time, work (their popups cover 20% of the screen area) i wasn't certain what the last item entered in the string series was so i had to do it all over from scratch. i lost part of the days work let alone the stress,.. but it all comes down to greed imho.

a few years ago bitdefender began doing this same type in your face popup ads months before it was time to renew. their product forums were filled with angry long time users that when faced with popups chose to leave in droves. i will be going with another vendor when this subscription runs out, assuming i can tolerate their ads for the next 11 mos.
