I give this product another try every couple years just to see how/if it's been improved. This is still better than a lot of the other choices out there, but still not the best, or the one that I actively use on my systems.

It seems to bog down the system down less, and use less resources than in the past. That could be because the computers are getting faster with more memory, and I just notice it less.

The software is easy to install, and is pretty much set and forget. Having anti virus and a firewall is always nice, and this is steps ahead the 'free' options Windows has. At least until it gets close to it's expiration date, as many others have noted, it does get annoying in it's reminders to renew.

It's a great price here at Amazon, and a better value when you install it on 3 machines, brings the price to a little over $11 for each machine.
