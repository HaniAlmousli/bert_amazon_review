Still the 800lb Gorilla but not the features are required.  The software is expensive What I do not like is Intuit is going the way of many software companies.  They bring out a new version every year and end the support the support of the product two versions back. Even though 2009 may work good for you, you will not to get support from Intuit.

If you are new to Quickbooks, Intuit makes it easy to get started with easy to follow guides.  If you are an experienced Quickbooks user I would not upgrade unless you are using 2009.

The integration with Excel is a time saver. The reporting is second to none.

Now may be the time to start looking at competitor products including Saas.  Sure you may have a monthly fee with Saas but you also get immediate access to enhancements without having to pay to upgrade to the latest version
