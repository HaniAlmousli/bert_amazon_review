TurboTax is a product I love to hate.  Of course Intuit is the monopoly and TurboTax is an Intuit product.  Why did all my other Mac Address book addresses blink in and out as I typed my registration name?  Even when I wasn't typing, the field kept on blinking.  It was as though Intuit was uploading all the names in the addressbook.  Then, when I looked for the use agreement, I couldn't find it to see if I had somehow agreed to give them my addressbook names???

Moving along, the TurboTax program's wording was better but still bad, leaving customers in the dark, even if we could read. The program crashed repeatedly while trying to copy my files to CD so it really can't do that.  Other than that, it was a little faster and easier, I suppose due to more interaction with the Feds and California.  Was my return right?  I doubt it. I think Intuit is still in a bit of a conspiracy to aid the governments in exchange for their networking.

The worse part was in the end when I saw the steep prices to file online.  There, true to Intuits form, I truly felt very RIPPED OFF!!!  I wondered if its lone large competitor, Taxcut, was the same way?
