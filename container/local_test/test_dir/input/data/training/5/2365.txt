I've long looked to Ulead VideoStudio as the best amateur video editing software out there, so I'm happy to finally get the chance to compare this package to those I've used in the past, namely the ubiquitous Windows Movie Maker and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Roxio-Easy-Media-Creator-Suite-10/dp/B000UJUJ7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10</a>.  I have to make clear here that I'm wholly an amateur when it comes to video editing (as anyone who has seen one of my YouTube videos could tell you), so all of the technical specs of software such as this are quite over my head.  The beauty of this product, though, is that it meets the needs of the newbie just wanting to edit his home movies as and offers up a huge buffet of options for advanced amateurs who know all of the acronyms, like to argue with other gurus about formats and resolutions, and produce darn-near professional quality videos for any and all occasions.  The software may initially look difficult to learn and use, but it doesn't take long to learn the basics - and then you can learn more advanced features at your own pace.

It goes without saying that you're going to need a pretty powerful computer if you want to use this software without tearing your hair out.  The system requirements are, in my opinion, something of a joke.  There's no way I would try running this with a mere 512 MB of RAM (or, in the case of Vista, even 1 GB); I would recommend at least 1 GB of RAM on Windows XP and 2 GB on Vista - anything less, and you're just asking for problems.  Memory becomes even more of an issue if you're going to be taking advantage of the wealth of HD capabilities this package boasts.  Those HD capabilities really are a big selling point, by the way (as you can tell just by a quick perusal of the box cover or product summary).  You certainly aren't going to be saving any HD videos to Blu-Ray using Windows Movie Maker.

The package comes with an impressive number of templates, filters, effects, etc., and the complete novice can rely on wizards to help him/her put together an impressive project.  Once you've mastered the basics, you have all kinds of enhancement options to choose from.  If you've thought about paying someone to put together a slideshow using old family pictures, forget about it.  It's easy to create a slideshow of images in VideoStudio, and you can basically control every aspect of the production, from inserting music to specifying the transformation settings from any one image to another.  It's almost as easy to create a video and truly customize it to your desires.  One particularly nice feature is the ability to add a voice track as well as a music track rather than limiting the user to one "audio" track.  You can also insert multiple overlays, which is another powerful feature.  And you can export your finished projects all sorts of ways: to your PC, to DVD, to online sites such as YouTube, and to iPods and a number of other portable devices.

VideoStudio isn't perfectly intuitive.  For example, you have a plethora of formats in which you can render a given file, but the rendering option is by no means prominent on the display.  I would also like to have seen some kind of cheat sheet for basic operations included alongside the manual, but I have to say this product manual itself isn't all that bad (although, as with most such software, your best source for information and guidance can probably be found in online forums and the like).  The manual is especially instructive in terms of setting things up and connecting to different digital and even analog video sources.

As far as the installation goes, I had no problems whatsoever (for the record, I'm running Vista with 4 GB of RAM).  Right off the bat, it came up saying I needed Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable SP1 Package and Microsoft DirectX Feb2006 Runtime, but the setup program installed those for me.  From then on, it was smooth sailing, including the extras that come on the bonus CD: WinDVD 8, MediaOne Plus Photo & Video Manager, and ULead Disc Image Recorder.

The bottom line in this: Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus is, in my opinion, the best and most economical video editing program for amateurs on the market.  Even if you're only interested in making the most basic of videos for any purpose, I would definitely recommend that you take a look at this package.
