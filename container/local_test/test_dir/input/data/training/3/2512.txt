I guess this thing is designed to be used by someone with an RV, big van, or something with a lot of room in the front, cause this is just not working out in a car.  With the laptop sitting on the passenger seat you really have to look away from the road a bit too long to check the map.  I like to see the map, not just listen to the voice tell me the directions.  I suppose if you had a passenger they could hold the laptop on their lap the whole trip and help you navigate.  I think the GPS/laptop combo is just too cumbersome to use if you are taking a trip in a car.  Buy the Streets & Trips without the GPS, or buy a dedicated GPS unit.
