Upgrade to 3 stars, because it support MP4, whereas PowerDirector 13 doesn't.
I've been reviewing Corel VideoStudio versions for some time now. I crashed it yet again. I just dragged video clips, and it crashed(!) I tried to drag the clip on edit container, and it seemed to put it in, but nothing appeared in the container. So why the extra star? Because of Corel ScreenCap, which I'm sure was developed by someone else. That tool is still the best of its kind. There's a lot of sound/video samples that come with this product, but they're hard to search for within the software. I continue to use CyberLink's PowerDirector, which is the best video editing software for Windows. Note: I'm using Windows 7 Home Edition.
