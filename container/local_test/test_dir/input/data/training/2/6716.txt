I've been using Quicken to manage my finances for about 20 years.  Quicken is a great aide and worth the time it takes to input income and expenses.  I upgrade almost every year.  The 2013 version, even though they've had updates to it since it was released, seems quite buggy.  If you're a Quicken user I suggest skipping the upgrade this year and waiting for the 2014 version to come out before upgrading.

Aside from the bugginess, one thing that irked me is that my hidden accounts, accounts no longer used came back to the forefront after my data file was changed for this version.  I had to figure out how to go in and officially close those accounts.  Two of the accounts wouldn't close, probably because even though they were zero'd out, Quicken still shows them each with a balance of .01 cent even though if I look at the account itself it shows zero there.  Buggy, buggy, buggy.  Wait until next year.
