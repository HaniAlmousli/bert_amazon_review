It does do the basics well enough and plays well with the rest of Microsoft's products. However, save yourself a lot of stress and stay away from this. Installation is a pain, it's extremely difficult to share between computers and don't get me started on the constant need to reenter information.

Office Accounting Express is available from Microsoft as a free download. It has a lot of similar features and even it is more than my family (read: not buisnesses) needs.
