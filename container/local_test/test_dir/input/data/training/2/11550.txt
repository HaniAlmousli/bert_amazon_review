I found CyberLink PhotoDirector 7 Ultra to be less than advertised. Its functions have been present in some form in virtually all better photo editing software for several years. Although the same functions are available in virtually all of the better photo editing software in such software it takes a bit more effort to implement those functions. However, the additional effort produces better results. For example; To achieve satisfactory results with the "Background Removal" in PhotoDirector use of a cloning tool is needed to smooth and blend the automatically replaced background. In most cases unwanted objects and background can be removed simply by using the cloning tool in virtually all better photo editing software. If you already have such software stick with it and learn to use the tools available.
