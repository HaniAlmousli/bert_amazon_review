Office 2010 Home and student edition ( Family Pack) with WORD, EXCEL, POWERPOINT and ONENOTE installs at a variable rate depending on your PC hardware. The visual install, looks like it has delivered you the whole suite, but thats just a fool-ya, or a Got-cha. Click on anything you did not buy in the option you chose, oops, another sales pitch. This version has so many similarities with its web page cousins that it is just beyond a joke, except that it has the big brand at the top "Not for Commercial use", an alternative that all other Office Versions, Open Office,  X5, and more do NOT display. The file page is quite literally massive in WORD with all its options for save , send open, Sharepoint, etc, and the Templates , the permisions , sharing and Versions components look nightmarish. EXCEL has the same set of web-like displays,same as Powerpoint. One Note does I admit look kind of intriguing, but why does a "Not for commercial use" edition have its front page with the Graphic of Notebooks "Work", "Personal", and "Classes"; shouldn't "work" be "taken" out since it is ipso facto for commercial use ? Although , it must be noted that One Note does have the general structure of the Web like WORD, EXCEL and POWERPOINT. Overall, the reduced function,  limited range, and the continuation of the annoying ribbon make this Office cutdown, not worth it ( Office without Outlook is like Smart Suite without Lotus Notes); Even Word Perfect Office X5 is a better deal with more to offer and less to restrict, the full version even has a free sharepoint server, where-as Office 2010 is simply Sharepoint compatible.
  After initial installation, before opening any Office component, you are offered access to the Microsoft version of the "cloud" ( at least that is what it looks like), and I have more concerns about the security issues with the "Cloud" as MS offers it than any other form of the cloud I have seen( plus if the MS Cloud Outages continue, then this could be rather precedent setting). And, if you happen to run TREND MICRO anti-virus applications on your PC, then the Office 2010 setup will be a most disagreeable meal for TREND and you must divest yourself of Trend Micro , at least for the moment.
 All in all another dis-tasteful new generation Office Experience.
