This program helps you author DVDs, convert videos to different formats, and capture still images and snippets from VHS tapes or DVDs. It worked fine for a while, but then bugs started turning up. Unfortunately, the free support only lasts a couple of weeks. Then, you are thrown on the tender mercies of the user forum. A review here on Amazon suggested that installing a previous version (we have two older versions of this program) might work. That did the trick. At this time, for the ways I use this program, there are too many bugs. Older versions work better. Perhaps software updates will take care of the problems in the future.
