Highly recommend not installing this on your system.  It completely took over my office computers and eliminated internet access, disabled all our printers and cost us almost two weeks of manpower to somewhat restore things to normal.

Uninstalling Norton 360 caused extensive damage, we had to reinstall multiple programs.

I would like to see a class action lawsuit against them to recover time and wages lost trying to fix the problems they caused.
