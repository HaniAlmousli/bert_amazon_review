I had been interested in joining ancestry.com for a long time and I am happy that getting this software gave me the excuse to join the site.  However, the software itself doesn't provide any features that make purchasing it worth while.  I didn't really find anything that was worth purchasing the software as opposed to just using the web site.  Also, I did find some problems with keeping my online family tree in sync with the software version. Sometimes the software just seemed to hang.  I also found the web site version easier to use and found myself using that version instead of the software.  So my answer is not to waste your money on the software.  If you are interested in joining ancestry.com then just go to the website.
