This product allows the average hobbyist to catalog and edit photos easily.  It is a straight forward application that is easily learned and used.  One of the problems with any photo program is that they don't present accurate color.  This is primarily due to monitors not the application with which it is manipulated.  A key point is to know your printer and calibrate it with your monitor.  I can highly recommend this application for those who are looking for an inexpensive photo cataloging and simple editing program
