I cannot believe amazon people are still buying quicken after years of bad reviews.  Quicken 2014 seems no different.  I still have quicken premier 2010 for windows and refused to be forced into an upgrade.  I now reconcile my VISA account manually.

someone at quicken needs to be fired.  do you think apple would put up with horrible product quality.  quicken loans got a jd power quality award.  I wonder how quicken software would fare.

wait 6 months before buying and see if anything improves.  do not be the first  to get arrows in your back.
