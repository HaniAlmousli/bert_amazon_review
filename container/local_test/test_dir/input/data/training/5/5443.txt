I have been using AutoCAD 2012 for over a month now and am extremely satisfied.  I installed the software on a Windows 7 64 bit machine with 12Gb of RAM.  The software runs very smoothly and I have had no problems with stability at all.  I have used several competing products and the latest version of AutoCAD continues to beat all.  It is bar none the best 2D drawing package on the market today.  So far I have seen no bugs.  The makers of AutoCAD are very good about releasing software updates when bugs are found and for providing other support.

What is the disadvantage of this?  Lack of 3D capability and a learning curve is about it.  I just wish the makers would release the full 3D version of AutoCAD at this price level.
