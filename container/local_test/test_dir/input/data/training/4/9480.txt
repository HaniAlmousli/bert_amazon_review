So far so good. I have the previous version (x6) and have noticed a few improvements. If you already have X6 I probably wouldn't recommend upgrading yet. The differences are there but they are not huge although I have to say I really like the new Magic Fill and that one thing will make it worthwhile to me when it comes around to yearbook time this spring.

I also own Photoshop Elements 12. Instead of tinkering here and there with each of them I would most likely be better served just learning one system but I have found that certain things are more intuitive and easier for me with one program than they are with the other and vice versa and so I guess I will continue to use both.

Overall I would say that the biggest difference between Paintshop and Photoshop is the interface. Both offer the ability to do tons of different things to your photos but, whichever software you choose, you need to be willing to invest the time to learn how to do it. While the software provides the ability there is still a learning curve and the more complex the project, the steeper the curve.  If you are comfortable with the format of one I would not bother switching.
