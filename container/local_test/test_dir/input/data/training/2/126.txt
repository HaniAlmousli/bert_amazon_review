If you're going to get an ND (Nancy Drew) game at all, don't get this one, at least not until you're done with all the other ones. Because this is the first one out of the entire Nancy Drew game series, it has terrible graphics. The people are 2D and look like they were cut out of a cartoon. It's even worse when the environment is 3D! Plus, you have to keep on switching between 2 disks! It's very tiring and annoying. If you have a fast computer, the likeliness of it is that it'll freeze a lot. That's what happened on my computer and it's fast, but when my friend played it (who has a slow computer), it only froze ONCE. But on the plus side, the whole concept of taking Nancy Drew books and turning them into interactive mystery games for children is brilliant. It's absolutely fun and educating but not to the point that it's boring. I don't suggest THIS specific mystery game, but I do suggest you start playing Nancy Drew games because all of them are fun except this one.
