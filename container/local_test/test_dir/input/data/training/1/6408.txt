Listen to the words of the reviewers who tell you that this product is unnecessarily troublesome to install (it took me three attempts to find success). Listen to the words of the reviewers who tell you that this product freezes (it happened to me four times ... and then I cleansed my system of it.) And, truly listen to the reviewers who inform you that this is "bloated." My Alienware is under a year old ... and I can feel the drag of this software. On a new computer? I cannot imagine what it would be like on an older computer.

As a number of reviewers noted, after every less-than-glowing review is a boilerplate comment from the company. They ask for more details about the errors. Anyone else have the impression that this product wasn't thoroughly beta-tested? Or maybe that people are paying nearly $100.00 to be beta-testers? That's a shame.

If this were freeware, I would have still uninstalled it (and I would have still used a cleaner after it). At nearly $100.00, I cannot imagine how anyone can think he/she is getting a product that reflects that (hefty) price-tag. A true disappointment.
