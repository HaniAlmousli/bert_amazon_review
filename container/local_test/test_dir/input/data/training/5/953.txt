Why spend a TON of money on Office XP PRO when you can have it all for just a little? If you are a student or teacher, look no further, this is for you. This full functioning office suite comes with Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook. It ONLY lacks Microsoft Access, which is a database program mostly used by professionals in that area of work. College students will likely never use it, therefore making this package perfect.

Thanks to Microsoft for keeping in mind college students and teachers and making it more possible for us to own their awesomely productive software for a reasonable price.

Enjoy
