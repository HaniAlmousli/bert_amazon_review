I got a new VAIO and couldn't find one with XP so had to get the latest unproven version of Monopoly with it aka - Vista.

The only good thing about it is that it is visually appealing but that is probably part of what makes it so sloooooooooooooow.

The bad - it is sloooooooooow, it crashed right out of the box, seems to not like Flash player, Explorer crashed a number of times just browsing the web, you have to play 20 questions every time you want to install something, its sloooooooooooooooow and this computer has 2 GIGs of RAM - there just isn't that much useful stuff that an OS could have to require anywhere near 2GIGs of RAM.

As soon as I booted it up for the first time and tried to shut down from the start menu, it wouldn't shut down and it didn't say anything, just wouldn't shut down so I had to manually power it off.

The screen flickers on and off at various times when Vista is doing certain things which is strange and sloooooooow but doesn't seem to hurt anything.

The touch pad comes with default settings that make it very difficult to move the cursor while staying in the current application or web page.  If you dig a little bit you can shut that annoying feature off, otherwise your browser starts jumping from site to site if you are using the touch pad to move the pointer.

If you are using something like WordPress that has JavaScript pop-ups to add a URL to your article you can temporarily disable that but it is very temporary and isn't clear how to make it permanent for specific sites.

It is better than Windows "crash" Millenium, doesn't hold a candle to XP thus far.  Unless you have to, don't get Vista, stick with XP.  There is so far no compelling reason to upgrade even if they were giving away the upgrades free of charge.
