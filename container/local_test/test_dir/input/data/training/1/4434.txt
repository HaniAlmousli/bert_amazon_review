Don't just walk away from this purchase, run!  This has got to be the worst photo software I have ever used.  I think the Express stands for how fast you are going to get frustrated with using the program.  From the ridiculous way it overwrites the original pictures to the slowness of the program, this software has got to be the worst out there.  I'd rather use the free built-in tools with Windows than spend a dime on this software package.

Of course its not just the features of the program that are awful, there is also the general Windows 7 incompatibility.  If you have made the switch to Windows 7 be prepared for a world of headache with this program.  From constant program crashing to its inability to use any of the new features of the OS (libraries anyone?) Photo Express is a good example of how not to design a program to make use of a modern OS.

My final word on this?  Stay away!  Run!  Run! Run!
