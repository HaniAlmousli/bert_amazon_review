When I first attempted to load this package onto my laptop I met one failure after another.  I tried to install it on my desktop but also failed.  Attempts to secure assistance from Kaspersky met with line-busy and unavailable help.  I finally installed it on my older desktop and used it for a while; however, I sent the old desktop to the local cyber grave yard along with Kaspersky.  I have installed almost every protection package on a plethora of computers and this is the only one that did not operate at any level of satisfaction.  I thought that if I would be able to try again and see positive results; however, after several attempts my level of concern increased and I took it off the other machines so that I did not incur other access while the computers were in potential dangerous areas.  I hate to leave my systems vulnerable especially since hacking has taken place before and I do not like it one bit.
