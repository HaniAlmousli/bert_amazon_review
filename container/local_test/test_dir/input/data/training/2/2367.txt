The fifth time was a charm (!) when I tried to install this software on my Windows XP based system. I have a relatively new system and so I did not anticipate all the problems I had in installing this software. I've used&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Premiere-Elements-4/dp/B000UK6OUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Premiere Elements 4</a>&nbsp;before and even&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nero-8-Ultra-Edition/dp/B000V9YXJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nero 8 Ultra Edition</a>&nbsp;for some light movie editing and never had a problem with the install or in burning the final DVD. With Ulead VideoStudio I am stumped.

The first 3 times I tried to install it the installation simply froze in the middle and I had to shut down my system to get it to work again. The 4th time I was able to load the software and then it asked me to insert the bonus CD which comes with WinDVD - the CD authoring software - and extra audio, video clips. The moment WinDVD started to install on my system it tried to delete some files which caused a fatal system error and I got blue screened. I began again the next day, I installed the software again and did not put in the bonus CD as suggested.

The software is easy to work with, it can convert your DV tapes to digital media or you can edit your digital media. It's easy to drop in your video clips, drag in audio and use transitions. You may not able to use your computer for much else while editing unless you have a very powerful system. However, once you're done editing, it can be very frustrating to go through the authoring process.

My system keeps freezing repeatedly and it becomes really difficult to create a DVD from this software most times. I am not sure if the hassle is worth my time, even though the software interface is intuitive and easy to use. If I get the system freeze one more time while trying to make a DVD, I am going to uninstall the software.
