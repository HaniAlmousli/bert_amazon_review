I keep hoping that the Mac version of QuickBooks Pro will function like the windows version so I can complete my migration from Windows to Mac and discard Parallels Desktop. IF Microsoft can make Mac versions of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint that function identically between Windows and Mac with perfect file compatibility, there is no reason that Intuit cannot do the same. The Mac version of QuickBooks is functional, but limited compared to the Windows version if you're already using it. Someday, just maybe, I will be able to write a better review.
