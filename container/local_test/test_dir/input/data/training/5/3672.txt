For home-use anti-virus/anti-spyware, I'm looking for three things:

1. Easy to install and easy to use

2. Operates light and doesn't slow down my laptop

3. The software works.

Trend Micro met all three of those expectations, so much so that I bought the full Trend Micro Internet Security Pro package for three users. After years of frustration with McAfee and Norton - software incompatibility and system resources bogged down - I am pleased with the Trend Micro experience.

I've also switched from IE to Firefox, which eliminated the frozen screens and slow Internet surfing. I recommend Trend Micro and Firefox, especially if you spend a lot of playing and shopping on the Internet.
