As with others, I have used the Delux version for years without issue until this year.  I was irritated, to say the least, with having to upgrade for something as stupid as "well, we want it to match the online versions we sell"!  What idiot takes away features?

Since i have been using this product for years, I did not want to have to change all of my data to a new system so I bought the "enhanced" product!  What a crock.  This version hounds you constantly to upgrade!!!!  Add to that the fact you cannot buy it without "State Tax Forms"  (We do not have an income tax in our state, why am I paying for this?) and they really did find a way to make things bad.

To add insult to injury, now Turbo Tax says they will refund the difference you had to pay for the version change.  The Catch?  You have to give them your SOCIAL SECURITY number!!!!  Why?  so they can get your last years tax return!!!  What do they need with my Tax Return??????  They have no business knowing what my taxes are!  Why should i trust them with that information?  So, here they go turning a bad situation into an absolute nightmare!!

I absoluetly will NOT use this product again after this year.  If I have to, I will go back to filing a paper form before i will ever buy from this company again!!!

I give it two stars because the software does work.
