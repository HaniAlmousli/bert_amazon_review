Works ok on Mac. As other reviewers have stated elsewhere the windows version works smoother and this version is not as robust as the one it replaces. That being said it does what it is supposed to but.... the days of the Microsoft Office being a needed program are fading fast. With open office and the word processor already on Mac (pages) along with open office and of course google docs I can see the day when they will hardly be able to give Microsoft Office away. Pages does the just about the same thing cheaper and Pages is the one I use most,
