Super for home or business networks.
In addition to this eight port, I also have the 16 port that i run my office with. The design and mounting of these switches is great looking and functional. First switch to ever look cool. Power supply is built in so there is no power brick / wall wart.
Simple to mount. Simple to setup. And simple to manage with software (windows only)'or direct IP address of switch through any browser.
You will be impressed.
