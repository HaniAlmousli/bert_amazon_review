I'm not a professional accountant - but I do my own accounting, for myself & wife (3 different companies).

I've used 3 different versions of Quickbooks in the past, but not in the last few years, & I've never tried the Quickbooks Online. I've always found the Peachtree/Sage products more intuitive, and this is no exception.

In terms of features, the Sage 50 can handle our 3 different businesses just fine (in fact it's overkill for us). However, the payroll & credit card functions are optional add-ons (which, for the asking price of this software, is a bit disappointing). You can do payroll manually for no extra charge (old-school style, you have to look up tax rates yourself).

If you're undecided, the big question is how you're going to use it. You might opt for Quickbooks if...
* You are doing larger companies
* You would like different users to be able to login
* You would like remote access
* Or if you want full payroll service

And if you're just not sure what you want, you can try before you buy. Both Quickbooks Online & the Sage web site have instructions for free trials.

Also, there is a "light" version of Quickbooks (the cheapest one right is $9.99 per month I believe, with the "full" version at $50 per month, and various levels in between). Finally, if you're just an individual or mom/pop business, you might be able to find free software or apps such as MINT, which basically just track your expenses & investments in one place, but it's worth mentioning.

Good luck!
