Not many manual controls. Otherwise, Norton Antivirus ("NA") detects, removes old at the installation, and blocks well new viruses from accessing through email, downloading, or copying, has a small initial footprint, but does not uninstall completely and leaves a residue interfering with superseding security programs, which requires a special uninstalling program from the Internet. NA is constantly up-to-date. It works fast and in the background, and allows manual customization in case of an atypical computer setup. A description of virtually every case can be found on the Internet.

Initially, NA takes up less than 100 MB of memory (RAM) that is much less than the competitors. However, not all memory (RAM) used to monitor the running programs is freed after closing them. But, it tends to slowly increase memory retention during or after using especially Web browsers. That so called memory leakage might drain away memory causing the computer to slow down to a crawl and theoretically even to a halt (crash). However, it is unlikely and would be unnoticeable at worst in and thus irrelevant to modern, multi-core computers with min. 4 GB of RAM (memory).

NA automatically updates its new virus data base via the Internet by the included 1-year subscription. Its operations are transparent in the background. It is as fast and thorough as other leading security programs. The installation is simple and fast. Everybody could do it.
