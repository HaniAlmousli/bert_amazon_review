As a reviewer with out the internet and self preparer, they still do not allow you do yor state return with out first accessing the internet.  I had the samr problem last year and I am frustrated.  I think next year, I will go back to doing it by hand and save money.  Now they wanted to charge a fee to print returns.  Lets get real, they should make Turbo Tax for the mass not only those lucky few who are able to afford the internet.

While I realize the internet is here and I fully support it, not all of us have access yet.  What about us.
