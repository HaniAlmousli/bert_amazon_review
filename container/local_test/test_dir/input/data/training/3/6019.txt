I've used this software to create a few videos. Once I figured out how to use it, it has worked okay, not great, but okay. My system well exceeds the system requirements, yet the software runs slow and is unstable. It has crashed on me a number of times. I have also found that it is not particularly user-friendly. It took a lot of trial and error before I figured out how to do simple things like mute a videos existing audio track and record my own. Ultimately, though, the product does do what it claims to do. I was able to create decent videos using it. I just think there are probably better options on the market.
