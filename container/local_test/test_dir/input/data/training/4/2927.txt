I was initially hesitant to purchase this instead of Turbo Tax due to the problems listed in these reviews.  I did end up buying Tax Cut when it was a Gold Box Special.  I just finished e-filing both my federal and state returns.  Everything worked out fine (with the exception that I owed taxes).

The only minor issue was that when I put in some information on an investment, it flagged a deduction entry as a potential problem.  Rather than guide me though what the potential problem was, it just referred me to an IRS publication.  I read the instructions, did not really understand the IRS directions, and so just continued putting in information in Tax Cut.

Otherwise, everything went fine.
