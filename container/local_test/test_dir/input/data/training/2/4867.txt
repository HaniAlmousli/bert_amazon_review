I have had this item for over a year and finally installed a few months ago.  However, I never got to use it a/c I never could register it.  I may be stupid -- Amazon has a telephone number to call and links to "guide me through steps (on the Internet) to acquire the registration Key."  It came with a key but nothing included in the sticker on the inside of the case works when you try to register it.  Anyway, I got tired of it taking over all of my photos and even anything that was scanned (documents, etc.) and not being able to view the items like I did before like slide show etc with Windows or Microsoft Office.  I never gave the program permission to be the program that works with my photos.  So...I uninstalled it.  Sorry I can't give any info on how it works.  It was weird to me so I gave up.  I prefer the software that came with either my HP ink jet printer or my HP Scanner. Photo Premiere - gives perfect color but I can't find an updated one.  Sorry.
