As a seasoned Photoshop user, I had to hunt and peck for similar functionalities with Pixelmator on occasion, but it's really not a bad program at all, especially for casual photographers who don't want the robust features of PS (and don't want to pay for the robust price tag!). Once you know where everything is, it is really quite usable. Basic useful adjustments including curves and levels are there. Nice ability to read raw formats. Very good price point indeed for what you get. Decently snappy with OS X, no complaints there.
