I have been a fan of the Quickbooks series for quite some time. Back when Windows 95 was the alternative to DOS I used to fight my boss about the benefits of Quickbooks over say, Peachtree which used to be DOS only. Move ahead to now and I don't think I would recommend this package to anyone. The overall functionality is there. The thing that really chafes me is the way they dangle "add ons" that you must purchase. Why? Its because they know the average user does may not need payroll. Fine, then don't ship it with the software. Instead, make this addon an inexpensive purchase, NOT a subscription. That is highway robbery. Sticking it to the small business that may use this software is underhanded and petty.

Pros:

>> Easy to use
>> Low learning curve
>> Basics are plenty for most small businesses

Cons:
<< Subscription service to add payroll & more
<< Feel ripped off when using this software like they just want to dip into your pockets every time you use it.

Overall if you just need a basic accounting software for your business you may be better off looking somewhere else. This package is "very" basic and you will need to add a good deal more subscriptions or addons to get it to the level of some higher priced initially, but overall better software packages.

Thank you for reading my review.
