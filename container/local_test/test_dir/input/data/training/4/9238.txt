We have quite a number of PCs in our home. Between laptops for remote use, PCs for work and then devices for gaming, it seems like there's a lot of opportunity for viruses to get into our network. I like the idea of having a 10 device set with just a single purchase, rather than having to buy individual protection for each PC on its own.

One downside is that the moment you activate the first one, the timer begins. So then you're impelled to race around and get the rest installed so they all get the full benefit of the full time period. If one of them happens to still have 3 months left from another software package, you're out of luck. And if you wait for that one to be ready, now you've left other machines unprotected in the meantime. So that's a bit of the pain, to get them all synced at the beginning.

I'm a bit unimpressed with their mobile offerings. They're not really doing much at all on the mobile end - and they count as a full "machine". I would rather they said 10 full PC / laptop installs plus toss in a phone or two as an added benefit. Maybe if you start adding more than that you could count them as a half - or something - but to have them be an entire PC's worth of protection doesn't make sense.

Still, I've always loved Norton from its earliest days and find them to be reliable and secure. I use my machines for work and it would take me a while to recover from a serious virus attack. So this is something I take seriously and want to ensure I have solid protection. I've never had an issue with Norton, and so far I haven't had any problems with this software either.
