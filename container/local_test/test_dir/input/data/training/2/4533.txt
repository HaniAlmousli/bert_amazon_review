There is not much to say for this piece of software. As others have observed, it is hard to find anything new and useful. Big change, the BANK tab. Older irritations are still there. This is comforting, since I would hate to lose my old friends and complaints. Intuit needs to hire someone that has some new ideas and a programmer to implement them. One hopes that a competitor comes along with stock update and decent bank access. Until then, plan to waste money every three years for an "upgrade" that one hopes does no harm.  The 2010 software seems to work OK. I already caught Quicken in one mistake, but it was easy to fix. The older version never made a mistake - but this is an upgrade, so you have to get something for your money - excitement. Personally, I like my financial management software to be boring, easy to use, and quick to finish the tasks so I can get back to something more interesting (almost anything, except taxes). I'll write more on Quicken 2010 after I get a chance to use it a bit longer.  I do like the new color scheme and the extra nag screens selling things.
