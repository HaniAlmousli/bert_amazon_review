Last year, I made the mistake of upgrading my Windows 7 Desktop System to Windows 8. I've been running Windows 8.1 since the Preview version that came out a few months ago, and the official release version that came out this week. While Windows 8.1 does make some improvements to Windows 8, it is still is not an O/S that is desktop friendly. On the positive side, you can now boot directly to your desktop without using a 3rd party utility, and the "Start Button" is back (sorta). On the negative side, Microsoft has still left out the "Media Center", and still charges a ridiculous $99 to purchase the "Pro-Pack" to regain the same functionality that was free in Windows 7(Home Premium). There is still lack of quality Windows 8 apps. Windows 8.1 does very little to improve navigation through the O/S if you're using a mouse/keyboard, and not a touchscreen. At least Microsoft did not attempt to charge Windows 8 users to upgrade.

Windows 8.1 does fix some of the issues people running desktop environments complained about, but it still does not go far enough. If you're running a touchscreen system, then 8.1 isn't bad at all. If you're not and have Windows 7, I'd think long and hard on whether Windows 8.1 is an upgrade or downgrade from what you have.

Edit: The April 2014 Windows 8.1 Update has further improved Windows 8.1 on a desktop environment. By default, the OS will now boot to your desktop if you're not running a mobile touchscreen device. There are also improvements if you're navigating with a keyboard and mouse. Switching back and forth between desktop apps and modern apps is much easier.
