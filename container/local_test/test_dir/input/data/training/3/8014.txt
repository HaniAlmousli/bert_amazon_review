In 2007 I tried Corel's PaintShop Pro Photo XI which has similar looks and features. I didn't like the PaintShop Pro XI and I don't care for this new Corel PaintShop either. Not that I don't like tweaking my photos to make them look better; but I'm not one to go overboard with fixing my photos, nor doing the complicated things you can do such as with PhotoShop. Picasa does almost everything I want for $0.00 and without me having to watch Corel tutorials to learn how to use it. I don't have the largest monitor in the world, a 20"--the tiny icons of PaintShop Pro causes eye strain.

No matter which computer I use, from my Dell in 2007 running XP (with the old PaintShop Pro Photo) to my new computer I got a couple months ago using Windows 8 (and this new version X6), the Corel software slows my computers to a crawl. My new PC is a 64-bit and I sure don't notice the lightning-fast speed this version 64-bit X6 software is supposed to have. I would choose Adobe Lightroom over this, much easier interface, much easier to learn how to do the more difficult photo editing tasks.
