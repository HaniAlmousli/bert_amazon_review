I was wary of trying this when I saw all of the bad reviews, but after buying and using it for 4 months, I don't regret purchasing it.  True, it seems a little disjointed, but once you remember that you use the program by using the top menu bar and do your navigation that way and through the little windows on the screen, one gets used to it.  But remember, this software wasn't written for Leopard.  I had no problem what so ever using it.
