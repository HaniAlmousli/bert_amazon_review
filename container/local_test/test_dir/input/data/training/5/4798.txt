I used CorelDraw many years ago but I made a switch to Adobe starting with freehand and Illustrator.  There was a little bit of a learning curve because I am use to Adobe. Thankfully there are video tutorials to help with the learning aspect.

CorelDraw Home and Student is almost as powerful as illustrator but at a much lower cost.  You just have to invest the time to learn it.

In addition to the vector drawing you also have the capabilites of photo editing.  Making the suite a bargain for home and student. The catch is you are not allowed to use this for commercial purpose, which means you can sell the images / work that you create with CorelDraw Suite.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who want to get into vectors grapics without the high cost of Adobe and learning curve that comes with the free inkscape.
