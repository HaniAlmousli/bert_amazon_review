This voice recognition software is okay and may be pretty good if you take the time to teach it your words, dialect and manner of speaking. I have used it only sparingly and I find myself just typing more often.

For now I think it's okay but i may up my rating if I get this software to type faster than me without many mistakes.

Overall, this really can be a very helpful tool for those with limited typing skills or someone with arthritis or joint pains. In such a case, it's worth the time and effort to train this software to work well for you.
