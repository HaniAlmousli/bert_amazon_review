I got a "free" trial version of this to try out and review. There are some things I did not like about the installation process. First, after entering a complex 25-digit code and my email and declining the auto-renew option, I was provided another complex code (15 digits) that I would need to activate the product. Since I was using a tablet that would not let me copy and paste, I had to go find a pen and carefully copy down the letters and numbers. Then I was asked to sign into iTunes with my ID and password. Then I was asked to verify my credit card my entering the code on my credit card. Whoa! This is a free trial and I declined auto-renew so why are they charging me?

I decided to go to this product page on Amazon to see what other reviewers experienced. On
many occasions I have found answers to questions on these pages. I did not find out whether I would be tricked into paying or not, but I did find a number of complaints about installation and about the application slowing down computer performance. Hmmm..

At this pointed I chickened out and decided to that the product is not worth the trouble. After all, our cable company provides a security software that is included with our service. Originally I thought I would compare services but I decided against it when I was asked for credit card information.

That said, McAfee is a respected company so if you purchase this, there is a good chance that you will be happy with it.
