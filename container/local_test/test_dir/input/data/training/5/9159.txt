I, like many people, used WordPerfect back in the day (late eighties). But over the years I moved on to using Microsoft Word as it became the de facto standard in most work places. I pretty much quit using MS Office at home when I left teaching and switched over to using a free license of Open Office. But I've been wanting to get back to using something a bit more polished. So when I was offered to try out the latest standard WordPerfect office suite from Corel I was happy to do so.

Installation was a snap. Individual icons get created on your desktop, as well as on the program menu. I'm running Windows 7 Professional.

WordPerfect is a lot different than it was back in the DOS days, but still very similar to any of the other Windows based word processors I've used over the years. I really haven't had to hunt too long to find where everything is located. Quattro-Pro is great, I use to use it a long time ago and am very happy to start using it again. Presentations - back when I was teaching, I use to create a ton of slideshows. Nowdays I really don't have a need to.

To test this new suite out, I opened a lot of my archived curriculum that I've developed over the years. Pretty much everything opened and worked fine. One minor quibble, some of the Powerpoint files had a issue with the display order of things - for example, text blocks that were obscured by graphics. But nothing that wasn't easily fixed. Quattro-Pro was a standout, everything I tried worked perfect and there were more options than I think I've ever seen for presenting data.

One thing that I really wanted to test out, but haven't had the opportunity is the ebook creation function of WordPerfect. I really want to set down and test this out more before commenting on it. I will update my review when that is done.

All-in-all, I really like this new Corel WordPerfect Office Suite and would recommend it.
