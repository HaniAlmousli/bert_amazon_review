While I found the software easy to use, I was quite irritated to find (at the very end) that to e-file, I would need to pay $17.95...and an ADDITIONAL $17.95 to e-file my state return!

Why on earth did I pay $40 for this software??  I downloaded a free version from the company's website last year.  The purchased version doesn't include much extra.

Now I have to print out my return and mail it in, because I'm not willing to spend a total of nearly $80 to do my taxes MYSELF!  I notice now that this fee is buried in the description above, but it certainly is something you'd have to know to look for.  It should be in giant letters right below the price!

Irritating.
