I usually review books, CDs and DVDs here on Amazon but I also - like you - need to prepare my tax return. Hence this review.

I've been using H&R Block's tax prep software (the Deluxe version) for at least 20 years and always found it the easiest to use and it provided good reporting. Until  this year's version. I prepared my first return - I do a few - last night and  first imported the data from last year's (2010) return  and then entered the data for 2011. There was a fairly large variation in the tax owed and so I thought I may have entered an incorrect amount. What I usually do then id go to "Forms", then "All Forms" and then choose "Two-year summary". This report compares each summary line on the return with the previous year - allowing you to spot an obvious error. But, the report was not listed. I thought maybe they renamed it and did a search. No luck. So I called H&R Block Tech support and spoke to two different staff there. When I showed them that, if they looked at list options under Forms for the two years they would find "Two Year Summary" missing. After being placed on hold for 3-4 minutes, the reps each told me ". No that form is not included this year". They had no explanation why.

In my opinion, this is one of the most useful fo9lms and H&R has taken one BIG step backward. The only way to do a comparison is to PRINT out both the 2011 and the 2010 returns and match the lines by hand. This wastes paper and takes time.

This may very well be my last year with H&R Block @ Home (formerly Tax Cut). Turbo Tax costs more - and is not as user friendly - but it offers this option (as far as I know).

So I'm alerting those who might be looking for the "Two-year Summary" that it is no longer included and have dropped my rating from what was once a five star rating to just 2 stars.

I hope you find this review helpful.
