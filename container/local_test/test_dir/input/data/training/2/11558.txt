I had high hopes for this program. I have been looking for a NON-Adobe product that does more to enhance my photographs than the free program I currently have. This promised great potential, since it is supposed to allow you to layer images, substitute faces, etc.; however, I did not find it lived up to my expectations.

My first clue that this was not the product for me came with its installation. One the one hand, I was impressed that this program came with a CD which I can keep as a back-up, or provided a link to allow me to download a digital version. It also has QR code for users to scan to link them to aps for their Android, iOS and Windows versions for other devices. But then I found out this is an "all or nothing" software. I like programs that let me determine what features I want installed on my computer. CyberLink doesn't let you do this. You get everything written onto your hard drive, and you can't disable anything. Not only that, but you get periodical pop-ups that nag you to add this or that for a price.

Like everything else these days, this program wants you to put everything in the Cloud. Not happening! That's a security risk I don't want. My stuff is mine, and I want it to stay that way--particularly creative work. Thankfully, this program gives you the option, but doesn't mandate saving images in the Cloud.

My biggest problem was importing pictures to be able to edit them. In the free version of Picassa (my current photo-editing program), all you do is double-click on a PDF or other image file, and it opens it for viewing (I set it as my default viewer, so it would do this). Then I click a button in the viewing pane that says, "Edit in Picassa." Bam! It's there, and I can start playing with it immediately. With PhotoDirector, you have to click File, then Import, and then go through this long rig-a-marrow to bring a photo into the program to edit. With Picassa, once you open a folder and start working on one picture, you can systematically scroll through all the files in that folder and modify them one-by-one. I tried this in PhotoDirector, but never figured out how to make it work.

Making the changes is not as easy or "intuitive" as some users made it sound. In most cases, you have to do a lot of clicking, tweaking, checking, etc., to get the enhancement you want. I really hate the crop part, in particular, because it consistently wants to retain the original aspect of the photo, even when you click that you want something else. You can do some fun stuff with people's bodies and faces, but I am not into caricatures as much as correctly representing people. The layering and background modification would be super useful for a graphic artist, but that's not my thing either. If I want to build a great-looking graphic, I find it's a whole lot easier to do it in Publisher.

My biggest beef with this program is how it saves stuff. With Picassa, you get your picture, change it, and then save it directly to the original location. You can either do a simple Control-S or click Save; or to rename and create a new file, do a Save As and put it wherever you please. To delete a file, you just right click and tell the computer to delete it, or drag it to your trash can. With PhotoDirector, it doesn't automatically save a single file to your original folder; you have to tell the program you want it there, and it saves multiple files at once--kind of like when you build an html file. If you want to delete something that has been through PhotoDirect, you have to close the program, or it won't let it go. If you are doing a whole folder of images at once, this gets to be a super time-consuming pain! It also changes the dates on your modified photos, so you don't have a record of when you originally took the picture and then modified it; you just have a set of dates logging the photo as having been created and modified on the day that PhotoDirect had it in its clutches. When you go back some other time to put photos in chronological order to create album pages, as I like to do, this makes your task really hard.

While this program has some cool features for the person with a lot of time on their hands and a truckload of creative energy, it is not for me. I like something quick, simple and direct, that doesn't make me jump through a lot of hoops to get what I want done. I want to control what goes onto my computer, and I don't want a constant barrage of ads to entice me to upgrade to a more expensive package or add features. I will be uninstalling this as soon as possible.
