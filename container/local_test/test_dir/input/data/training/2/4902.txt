Corel makes it look like you are getting a good deal because one is getting four products (Paint it, Photo Album, Scrapbook Artist, and PanoramaPlus X4) At first glance one may believe he or she is getting a great deal. Sure the price is more than fair for what you get. The problem I have is the software is not that powerful.  You would be better using Google Picasa for organizing and editing your photos. That takes care of Paint and Photo Album.  Yes the Paint It products does have more filters you can apply to your photos to make them more artistic.  The reality is while it is fun to play with, I only need to enhance my photos. You could also spend a little more and get Photoshop Elements. Even Serif offer free photo editing software if you go to their website.

You can get a good free photo stitcher from Microsoft. Search for Microsoft Image Composite Editor.

I am not a digital scrapbooker but your cost can rise quickly as you buy add ons for the software, which makes the software more expensives

While the product is not expensive I would recommend it to my friends and family because Picasa gives them more than enough feature for free
