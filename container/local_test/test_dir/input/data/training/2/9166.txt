So thankful I backed up my videos and photos that dated back to 2004 before installing this software. Cyberlink wants to do file associations of its own and I don't like it for this reason. Otherwise, this software would be decent....it worked fine with Windows 8.1, the user interface is easy on the eyes and it played any video format I wanted.
