There is not much to love with this set.  First of all, you get four separate programs, each with its own installation disc.  That you means you do four separate installs and have to type in four separate very long serial numbers.  In the Photo Album 7 alone, the program was a separate install from the clip art and the user guide, so if you want those, add two more installs to that list (although without 2 more serial numbers).  That annoyed me right in the beginning.  Then, the programs are very light on functionality and limited in options.  The photo program offers no more than I get with the free program that came with my Canon camera, and if I want more functions than that, it tells me I have to buy and install yet another program, Paint Shop Pro Photo.  I was very unimpressed.  The one capability it had that was value-added for me was the ability to burn a disc of your photos; my other photo program doesn't have that.  The paint-it program turns your photo into a painting-like image, which I can see would produce interesting images if you wanted a stylized version of your photos.  I rarely want that; I really want to see my photo in all of its glorious detail.  I already have scrapbooking programs that are more functional than the one that came with this set, which is a little bit tedious and annoying to use.  I selected the "Hip to Be Square" layout and tried to drag photos to the large boxes in the center of the page, but I was not allowed to do that; you can only drag a photo to the boxes labeled "Drag photo here."  This is pretty restrictive in terms of the creativity you're allowed.  The panorama plus is a nice and rather useful program if you don't have a camera that already lets you stitch images together.

Overall, I just felt that I would rather have just one program with all of these functions integrated into it, and I would like much more functionality than these provided.  They could keep the nice user interface and the simplicity and just beef up the functionality without making you buy more programs.  Of the four programs, the one I would most like to see enhanced for more functionality would be the photo program.  I thought I was going to be able to correct my photos much more extensively than this program allows.  On the other hand, if you are a beginning computer user with no existing software that does any of these things, this might be a good choice for you, because the programs are not difficult to use and provide basic functionality.
