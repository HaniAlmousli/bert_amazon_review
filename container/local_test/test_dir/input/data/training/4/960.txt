I'm a big fan of Nancy Drew games, and The Secret of the Old Clock is a bit different from some of others.  This is the only Nancy Drew game that takes place in the past- in the 1930s.  It's also probably the easiest of the Nancy Drew games I've played.  Nancy undertakes to help her orphaned friend Emily, who has inherited her mother's inn, and fallen into a deep state of melancholy.  The inn has been experiencing strange accidents, and it's up to Nancy to figure them out.  The puzzles in this game were a bit easier than the standard Nancy Drew fare.  Also, there weren't as many locations to investigate as some other ND games.  In particular, there's very little to do in the inn, and one of the things ND games do so well is to set up spooky, old, searchable houses.  That said, the game is still fun, and this is a great ND game to start with, if one is new to the genre.
