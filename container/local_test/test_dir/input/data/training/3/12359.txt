For over two years I have periodically attempted to retrofit this software to my needs and objectives largely without success. That is not a condemnation of the application, it is an admission the capabilities here are vastly beyond my business needs so the underlying motivation to exploit it to the fullest is just not there.

Frankly, the only thing I've really done is map routing and that is tragic misapplication, one that can be as effectively and efficiently accomplished with my GPS.  I can easily see where this software could be highly beneficial to business entities where business marketing and acquisition expenses for multiple associates is a significant factor but in my case site to site travel is not a primary functionality.
