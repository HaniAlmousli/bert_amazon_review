Where do I begin with their lies and deception?

1) Small size on HD! Not true. ALL of the data hides in programdata/WRData and can baloon up to 50, even 100GIGS on your hard drive. Even quickly filling your SSD's.. Webroot takes up the most HD space of any AV.
2) Small footprint! NOT true. Webroot rides on the SYSTEM process in windows. Often ballooning the system process to 500% over normal. This bogs everything down and is a deception by Webroot who claims it's an 'old bug' (claiming this for 5 years)
3) Advanced technology! Not true. It's a simple karma/reputation and whitelist/blacklist app. It tosses your unknown stuff in a sandbox monitoring it. This requires constant tickets to support for whitelisting with EVERY new version of EVERY software.

Webroot is a product no serious security/IT person would ever deploy. It's a joke!
