Trend Mocro Internet Security Pro provides very good protection from virus and worms, and it is a very good replacement for the default Windows Firewall. Since my email server already protects me from Spam, I haven't really been able to evaluate that so far (nothing has penetrated the email server). The interface is well laid out and easy to navigate. As a whole, Internet Security Pro seems to do an admirable job of protecting my Windows Vista computers (another good aspect: this will protect up to 2 computers).

Where Internet Security Pro really seems to fall down (though I would suspect that Windows Vista probably should take some of the blame as well) is in the resources department. My fastest laptop takes nearly twice as long to boot up with this software package installed! Though Windows Vista is booted to the desktop, I literally cannot open any applications or do anything until it is done loading Internet Security Pro. Though the protect isn't as good, McAfee did not take anywhere near these resources at boot up). I do not perceive any real drag on the machine once it is up and running, but I turn the computer on before hopping in the shower otherwise I will sit there watching it get started.

My complaints are probably just a sign of the times for internet security, but it really feels like the software is a bit bloated.
