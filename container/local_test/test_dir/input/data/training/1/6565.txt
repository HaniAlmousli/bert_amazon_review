I just don't get it.  What was Microsoft thinking when they released Windows 8?  We had this operating system installed on our new computers for our office and it has been one nightmare after another after another.  Nothing seems to work as it should and it is so different from the previous versions that it just boggles the mind.  All I have now is a group of very frustrated workers who can't finish projects, transfer date, printer and numerous other compatibility issues.  As a matter of fact, we are in the process of stepping back to windows 7, at a great cost to our financial pocket.  If you are in the same boat, or about to purchase this program for your home or office computer, think again.
