I was very disappointed in Turbo Tax for the 2013 tax year.  When entering deductions, where you used to be able to just enter a figure from my Quicken Summary; you now have to break it down into multiple lines for the program to accept it.  Is this Intuit's idea of a positive Turbo Tax Update or is this the IRS cracking down and telling software companies to make it more difficult to take earned deductions???
