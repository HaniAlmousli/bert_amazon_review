We're only a few days into this an we have picked up a few catch phrases already. It's also neat because it has a level 1 companion app that you can take with you. It has 3 levels, from beginner to intermediate. It comes with 1 software DVD program and 1 interactive DVD. My favorite is the CD that contains 10 hours of audio listening, so I can drive while learning. It has a computer called Who is Oscar Lake & a pocket  phrase guide. Level 1 starts off with vocabulary, level 2 expands to the complex phrase and conjugations of the verbs & pronunciations, level 3 gives you some advanced dialogue and conversation. I like everything that comes with this package. our family will definitely benefit from it. Worth the money if you'd like to expand your knowledge of the Spanish language.
