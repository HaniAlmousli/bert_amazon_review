I have been a happy Kaspersky Internet Security for 3 years and was excited to try the expanded features of Pure. On the plus side the technical support is great whether live chat, phone or email. I did have to use it to get my computers linked to use the parental controls because the instructions were missing a setting change. I did get them connected but the next time I tried to connect they would not recognize each other so I just gave up on that. The encrypted data vault is a very nice feature as is the file shredder, I wish those were available with their Internet Security package for those of us who don't need or want all of the big brother parental controls. Currently I have an issue with super slow scans, last time I started a full scan it told me it would be completed in 20 hours when 30 to 45 minutes would be more typical. So I will be contacting support again for that. Unless you really want/need the parental control features of Pure I think you are better off with Kaspersky Internet Security.
I am giving it 4 stars mainly because I like their anti-virus program so much. I have tried all of the major anti-virus and internet security programs and Kaspersky has always done the best job of keeping cooties out of my computer not just catching them after they are in.
