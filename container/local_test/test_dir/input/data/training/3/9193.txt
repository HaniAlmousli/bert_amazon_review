If you are trying to avoid Microsoft products, or just don't care for MS Office: this or "Open Office" are clearly the way to go.  Though I did discover a few compatibility issues when going between MS Office files and WP Office - for the most part you will be able to do what ever it is that you need with this software.  The times I ran across the compatibility problems where when opening documents created in Word that had heavy formatting, images or tables.  None of these wanted to come out properly when opened with WP Office.  This did seem to run more efficiently on my computer and install was a breeze.  I like the built in PDF options and the ease with which you can turn things into e-books.

I enjoyed the old school layout, though that might be a negative to some people.  I just found that things were more intuitively placed around the programs.  Unlike my newest version of Word and Excel that I use at work where I find myself hunting for the option I know is there but has been moved.  Everything in this seemed to be right where I expected it to be.  Very user friendly.
