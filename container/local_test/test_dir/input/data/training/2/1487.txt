I spent $2,000 on a Dell laptop. Also, I upgraded to Vista Ultimate and Office Ultimate. This software is so damn junky! It doesn't work! Office works terribly on Vista, constantly freezing and crashing.

After 10 years of PC use, I've got an Apple computer coming in the mail right now.... I'm DONE with Microsoft!!
