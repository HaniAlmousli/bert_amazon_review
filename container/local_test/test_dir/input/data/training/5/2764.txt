We were struggling with how to share a limited resource that needed to be tested by several developers.  The test resource was off in a room far away from me and upstairs from another developer.  Loading our tests onto laptops was a pain.  With Anywhere USB we can all share.  We all run Messenger to chat to coordinate access.  It even works over our wireless lan.  I have used Digi products for years.  As always they just work without any fuss.  Configuration was mostly easy.  It takes a few minutes to load all the drivers.  But once that is done....It just works.  No hassle the next morning.  Great product Digi.  It is a delight to work with such well designed equipment as all the products I have used from Digi.
