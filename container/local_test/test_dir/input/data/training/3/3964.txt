I was able to make this work but it takes time.  This product was an early entry into the area of doing vhs to dvd conversion at home.  It comes with the adaptors you need but the software is buggy and it took me a while to get it working.  There are newer and now better products out there if converting vhs to dvd is something worth while trying on your own.  Otherwise spend the money to have a local store do it for you.
