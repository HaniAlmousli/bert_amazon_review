I originally had thought this was going to be a poor product based on all of the bad reviews written here and on my past experiences with some other Norton products. It has actually turned out to be a very good product for me. I installed it on the family PC running XP SP2. It was easy to install and I did not encounter any problems at all. The program has worked wonderfully now for a couple of weeks. It removed several spyware programs and has tuned up the computer quite well. I had AT&T's internet suite before this and was not happy with it. This seems to be doing a better job because my computer now seems to run faster and smoother. I will update this review again after a month of using it. So far I like it.
