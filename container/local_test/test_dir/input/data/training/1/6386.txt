You need to be very patient to use this buggy software. And to use the added features is going to cost you. It's like buying a nice inkjet printer and finding out that ink costs more than the printer. All that I swear I've had more Mormons visiting my house since I started using this. Seriously. I stopped using it and went to something more reliable.
