Windows XP SP2 is a headache especially if you are upgrading.  Windows XP started out as pretty good and then the Microsoft Committees ruined it.  People who have upgraded have had trouples with devices not working, Anti-Virus software not working correctly and guess what--IT STILL HAS SECURITY FLAWS! The IT world has had nothing nice to say about this crappy SP.
