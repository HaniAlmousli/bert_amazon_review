Pinnacle Studio 18 is not a bad program. It is quite simple a bare bones package. I like Pinnacle software and am running Studio 17 Ultimate on another computer. I must say that this 'upgrade' to the regular Studio 18 offers me less features than the older Ultimate Version of 17.

First, this new Version 18 only runs on Windows 7 and 8. Version 17 ran on those as well as Vista. Keep this in mind when purchasing it, the system requirements have changed. I have 17 loaded on a computer that uses Vista and loaded the new 18 on the newer computer that runs Win 8. Installation was not a problem. I have installed a lot of these types of software before and rarely run into problems. Once installed, I was not impressed with the lack of features it offered. I am aware this is the basic, most inexpensive software package in the Pinnacle 18 line, and it does work fine.

If you are looking for a program that does the basics (plus a little more) and is easy to use, then this Pinnacle Studio 18 is fine. But I would suggest to spend the extra money for one of the better programs as they really do allow you a great deal more features. This is indeed NOT a bad program. It works well and does what it promises. But for ME, I need a little more than the basics.

I can recommend this software. It would be fine for the person who is looking for a good program without spending a lot of money and not needing any elaborate features. But for anyone looking to do more, spend the money and get a better version. It is well worth the extra price.
