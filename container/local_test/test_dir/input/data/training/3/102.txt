Easy to use. I like that you can use it on your computer but also learn more by transferring lessons to your iPod and learning while on the go. I learned a little bit but it didn't completely hold my attention or make me feel immersed. Granted, I should have tried this more but nothing compelled me to keep coming back to it.
