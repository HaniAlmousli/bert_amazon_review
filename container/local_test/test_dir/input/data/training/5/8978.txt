Sony usually has excellent software to bring to the table, and they're keeping that trend going with the Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite. Installed on a Microsoft Windows 8 Professional machine with an Intel Core i7 processor, this editing suite is super stable and leverages the multi-core and hyper-threading features very well making this suite very efficient and fast.

The various editing tasks are assigned to their own editing programs within the suite, making each editing task such as audio, video, and so-forth more focused with better working features that aren't just all clumped together and inefficient. Sony allows you to focus on the specific task at hand without distractions, and the navigation through the various settings and tools is very intuitive and easy.

If you do a lot of video editing, this suite will end up saving you a lot of time in the long run because of it's efficient and well laid out design that lends itself to a smoother workflow. Bear in mind, however that is a more simplified, consumer oriented suite that is meant to provide with both the basics and quite a few extras, without over-encumbering the suite with a lot of professional level features that most people wouldn't be able to take advantage of, but also without stripping out too many of the features, making this a very well balanced editing suite perfect for the beginner and advanced hobbyist alike.
