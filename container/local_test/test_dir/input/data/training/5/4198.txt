It's everything I could possibly want in a Windows upgrade. It's built from the ground up; the performance is spectacular and the interface is highly streamlined.

My 2009 upgrade to Windows 7 (32-bit) from my Windows Vista (32-bit) laptop went effortlessly. The leap I made today to an upgraded Windows 7 (64-bit) installation for my destop computer, from its existing Windows Vista (32-bit) installation, went even more effortlessly with a completely clean, hassle free, boot-up install. It's a tremendous improvement, too.

Windows 7 offers a completely fresh, new experience. It does away with Vista's default access confirmation dialogs brought about by its security model. In addition to many incredible new and significantly enhanced features, it also leaves behind some of its legacy software which it used to install with the OS, and this further refines the core package.

The Windows interface is much more responsive than ever before with the docking options and the "show desktop" button among several other improvements. The interface is beautiful to look at. Security is easier to manage and I have yet to have any issues running any of my software.

I've never disliked any of the Windows versions that I've owned, although I did pass on Windows Me when it made its rounds. As a Computer Science student, I really put each of the versions through their paces. Windows 7 is my favorite and the best Windows to date. I'm truly thrilled with this new version of Windows!
