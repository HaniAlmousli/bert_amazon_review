After playing around with my review copy of Pixelmator, that was the question that kept spinning in my mind: "Yes, it works, but is it worth the money? Would I pay for this, or buy something else?"

I think it depends on what type of user you are.

If you want to do some fun, different effects easily to your pictures, honestly, Pixelmator isn't for you.  Yes, it can do a lot of manipulation, but there is a learning curve, and to really make it fly you're going to invest hours in learning all its ins and outs.  Casual users would be better off sticking with online free or low-cost manipulators like [...] (my favorite!).

What if you say you really want to get into advanced photo-manipulation and do all kinds of spectacular stuff?  Well then you might want to invest in something high end like Photoshop or a little lower like Aperture.  If you don't have any money you can get GIMP, which is a very powerful program but a little cumbersome to use, for free.

So Pixelmator is stuck in the middle, between the free, easy, less powerful online programs and the very difficult, very powerful, very expensive programs like Photoshop.  If you want more power than what you can get from online editors and have some time to invest to learn the program, Pixelmator would be a good choice.  BUT.... I think most casual users would actually do better to stick with online editors, and most power users will want something with more horsepower like Aperture or Photoshop.  Bottom line: Pixelmator is a fine program, but probably isn't for you.
