I've used Acronis True Image for more than 10 years and it HAS saved my bacon at least 3 or 4 times.  In the "old" days, either Windows would corrupt your drive or, the inevitable, a drive would fail after about 3 years.  Now, it seems to me that drive failure is the biggest problem.  It WILL fail, you just don't know when.

I don't bother backing up just "critical" folders.  I "image" the entire drive once a week.  Sure, you can save your folders and data, but a large concern is getting your OS and software back to where it was.  Nowadays, you don't even have a disc, you download from online.  So, getting your software back is problematic and time consuming.  Along the way, there are the updates that you don't have even if you have a disc.

So, I "image".  I used to image to a second drive in my "tower".  Now that I have a laptop, I image to an external hard drive.  This takes six or seven hours but is not a problem if you do it at night.  Just when things look stable, Acronis comes out with a yearly update.  Being stupid and cheap, I usually upgrade to the newest version for a reduced price.

Whatever the reason, every version of Acronis comes with a new "GUI" that you have to learn as well as installation problems and bugs that take a year to resolve.  I now understand that you're going to have to pay yearly "license renewal" fees for a lot of things.  It's simply "cost versus benefit", like antivirus software.  If I didn't absolutely need Acronis or something similar, I wouldn't buy it.  But, I haven't really found anything else I trust yet.

Things started to go to hell again in 2011.  I ordered 2012 but it would not install.  Okay, so I'm still able to backup.  Then, 2011 got corrupted and would not run.  Since my copy of 2011 was a result of several yearly upgrades, it would not have been easy to re-install and work my way back.  So, I went to Amazon and purchased a full copy of 2011.  That worked fine until I upgraded to W8.  Remind me again to write "I will never be a first adopter again" on the blackboard 50,000 times!  W8 didn't like 2011 (and several other programs).

Okay, I'll pay.  I downloaded the trial version of Acronis 2013.  But, it wouldn't install!  Without going into detail, it didn't like the fact that I had Seagate "DiscWizard" installed.  Guess what, Acronis WROTE DiscWizard but couldn't uninstall it!  So, after much screwing around and communication with support, I was able to install 2013 and image.

Because of comments from another, I think I'm going to buy several drives that fit my laptop and "clone" my C drive rather than image.  Replacing a drive in your laptop may be a challenge for some but maybe, it would be quicker and more reliable.  I have already done it when one failed.

In conclusion, I hate the yearly change in the Acronis GUI.  I don't use any of the features they have except for imaging (cloning), but I have to have this or something like it.  I can't say that I have done an exhaustive search, but other backup programs that do imaging don't let you "mount" the image as Acronis does.  This way, you can look at a few files to get some confidence that the backup is intact.  So, again, after many years, I'm going to trust the devil I know.

Edited a few days later after I successfully cloned my C: drive.  I "bumped" the stars up to 4 because cloning worked and was much faster than imaging.  I had been imaging to a 1 terabyte, 3.5" drive externally using a Thermaltake "BlacX" SATA USB docking station.  With the terabyte drive, I was able to save at least 3 images.  But, I never realized that by having all images on the same drive I would lose all if the drive failed.  Since the "BlacX" docking station also accommodates 2.5" drives, like the one in my laptop, I ordered a drive like the 500 gig drive used in my ACER laptop.

I cloned to this new drive which took only about 2 hours instead of 6 for imaging.  Also, after the cloning, you can look directly at the drive by using "my computer" without "mounting" it like you have to do with an image.  So, a little time savings.  Just to be sure, I popped open my laptop and swapped the C: drive for the newly cloned one.  Everything worked perfectly.  My plan is to buy another drive so that I can rotate cloning the two drives and always have two backup drives.  Now, it would take three drive failures, the original C: plus the two clones, before I lose everything.  Cost-wise, the cost of two 2 500 gig clone drives is about the same as the single 1 terabyte drive I was using for imaging.  Thanks to a previous reviewer for suggesting cloning.
