Over the years I have criticized Quicken for bugs etc. This is a nice polished version. I am installing it now so I have release 2. It is a good priced product, polished over several decades. Went on perfectly - and added a reasonably priced and efficient online backup at 1/4 the cost of the previous OLB. They give us a lot for our money. I do wish they had the great free support they had only a few years ago. I never need CS but it is nice to know it is there! Few other firms give us this much for the money.
