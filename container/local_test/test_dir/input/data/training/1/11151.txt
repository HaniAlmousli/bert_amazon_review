Used to be 5 stars, but they are pushing Cloud service so hard it is irritating.  They don't respect your decision to not want it.  Acronis wants to suck everybody into keeping backups, files - everything in their cloud.  They charge a yearly fee for this, but think about it:  If you want to cancel, you will have to download all that information - maybe years worth -back to your computer before you can stop the fees.  It could take a long time at internet speed to clean out your stuff.  Don't fall for it - you could be spending a lot more money than you think. - and of course, they can raise the fees after the first year.  As a side note: The backup software works fine but the GUI is poor. As an example: There is no context sensitive Help and you have to click on an icon to tell what it does.  Most new software allows you to hover the mouse pointer over the icon and it displays options so you can quickly determine if it is appropriate. PS: After using for a month or so. I now give it 1 Star.  Note: After  months of using this software and two major upgrades it is still bad!  The last update  on 4/29/2016 (Win 7 Pro) caused errors on my computer -"Acronis Stopped Running.....".  I tried to uninstall and reinstall, rolled back registry all to no avail.  I finally had to restore using an earlier backup.  So backup software that is supposed to protect my computer caused me to have to do a restore.  What is going on at Acronis?  8/31/16 - still using product - hasn't gotten any worse, but the user interface still drives me nuts. I've tried a few disk image restores and they work fine. The core software is good, but GUI is bad. PS: Been using Acronis 2016 for many months and it is now on my list as the worst backup software you can buy.  I actually had it mess up my computer to the point where even a registry restore did not work - bad software stay away!
