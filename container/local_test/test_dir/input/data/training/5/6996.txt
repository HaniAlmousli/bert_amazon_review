If you've ever done any video editing with Cyberlink before, you know you are getting a quality and intuitive product.  In this suite, you get very well executed context sensitive editing.  It offers features like it needs a lot of CPU under the hood, but it ran perfectly on my older Windows 7 PC.  It has all the standard elements for editing suites today.  You can do 3D, you have BluRay authoring.  You also have support for 4K video, assuming you have a 4K camera and a hard drive the size of a room!  The program is easy enough for a beginner to get started on basic editing, yet powerful enough for a professional to do all his work.  Definitely a must buy for videophiles!
