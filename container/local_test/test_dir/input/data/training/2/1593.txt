March 15, 2009: I wrote a review for ZoneAlarm (see below) over a year ago. Recently I updated my computer to version 8. The problem with ZA being a cpu pig continues to be bad. The process scanningprocess.exe still hogs the CPU every time you try to use the computer.  Turning it off under  "antivirus - advanced options" restores the performance of your computer at the expense of ZA not scanning every file that comes into the cpu. Most of the files that you use are simply routine application files that ZA checks over and over at the expense of bringing the performance to a crawl. What you want ZA to check are new files that it has not seen before, but ZA is not smart enough to make the distinction. Norton Security Suite used to be the champion CPU pig along with McAfee, but Norton has now solved the problem. Both XP and VISTA will run smoothly with Norton with only a very modest tax on performamnce (unless you look you will never notice its tiny affects). It's too bad. ZA has been my favorite for many years. I like the level of control it gives you and I like the near-perfect firewall, but the perfromance hit is too much. Now, Nortin has improved its firewall and Antivirus components to match or exceed ZA. For me it's bye-bye ZA, and buy-buy Norton.

ZoneAlarm 7.1 for Vista is not ready for retail sale. Once you install it with Vista, your computer will likely slow to a crawl. The reason is simple (for most people).  Zonealarm security suite will continuously run two processes, both called scanningprocess.exe, that along with another ZoneAlarm process, VSMON.exe, will consume most of your cpu. There seems to be no way to turn this off. On my machine, a new Lenovo with 2GB of ram, the cpu useage bounces around from 17% to 90%, with most of the time being above 50%. WIth so much of the computer's resources consumed, there is little left for you, the user. Plus, if you do something,such as starting a program, the useage jumps even higher. Finally, even though ZoneAlarm has just finished updating its files, it will continuously run updclient.exe, which takes up about 25% of the cpu.  The company that produces ZoneAlarm, CheckPoint, will not respond to customer inquiry about this problem. So, go ahead and install it, and see if I am right. Oh, I forgot to mention, once you install it, it is hard tocompletely remove the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Zonealarm-Internet-Security-Suite-3-User/dp/B000Q1N7FS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Zonealarm Internet Security Suite - 3 User</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ZoneAlarm-Internet-Security-Suite/dp/B000HKPB3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite</a>program.

After posting this message, I have found a way to "solve" the problem of ZoneAlarm being CPU pig. You will have to turn off "On Access Scanning".  Go to the AntiVirus/AntiSpyware tab and click on "Advanced Options", the click on "On Access Scanning".  Uncheck the Enable Box. Click OK.  In a few minutes your computer should return to normal civilized behavior.  You have lost a valuable feature, but, hey, you can actually do something useful on your computer.  This problem does not seem to affect the older versions under XP.  Good Luck!
