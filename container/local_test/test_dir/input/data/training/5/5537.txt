Omnipage has  long been the premier converter for anyone seeking to reduce the tedium of copying hard copy into a word processor so it can be edited.

Yet, the makers have continued improving Omnipage until this, the latest version, is now approaching perfection. I think the only improvement now needed is for the next version to grow nimble fingers that can flip the sheet over for scanning the other side, then toss out the sheet and grap the next and place it atop the glass.

Seriously,  this is a must buy!
