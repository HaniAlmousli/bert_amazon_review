The same old good software I use every year to make submitting taxes easier. Cheaper than paying H&R Block, but just as effective for my situation (Married, filing jointly, we both work, have one kid, own a house, a dog . . . nothing really complicated). This is my first year buying from Amazon (I usually get my copy from Costco, but Amazon was the same price). I have never done a digital download from Amazon before, but it worked pretty easily. Just download and install, that's it. The one thing I think is silly is the fact that there is a $20 fee to eFile State (Federal is free). You'd think that the state would want to pay us to make their job easier, but no, so they'll be getting a fat envelope by snail mail from me.
