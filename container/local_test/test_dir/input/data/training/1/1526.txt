Norton Internet Security 2007 has to be one of the worst products that I have ever purchased.  It slowed my PC to an unacceptable level.  When I disabled some of its unnecessary functions, it continued to slow my PC and gave me the bonus of irritating & uneccesary notifications/ warnings.  I was a longtime, dedicated user of Norton, but that has changed.  Try something else and avoid reduction of speed, adding an addtional bar to screen your screen, additional clutter and other deficiencies. If Amazon had a rating for less than one star, I would have given one of those negative ratings.

Amazon should not sell an item with such poor quality. I have yet to see somebody say something good about it which would come close to justifying its negative characteristics. CAN SOMEBODY RECOMMEND AS BETTER ANTI-VIRUS?
