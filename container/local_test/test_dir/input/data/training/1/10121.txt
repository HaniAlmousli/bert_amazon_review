I have used Turbo Tax for years and imagine my surprise that starting in 2014 they removed Schedules C, D, E & F and the supporting worksheets!  Raising the price of the product is one thing, but removing forms and not telling the customer until you buy the product and find out that not only can you not import last year's data, you can't even manually fill out this year's taxes!  Dirty, dirty trick!  I often wonder how companies that are at the top of the heap can fade out of existence so quickly.  Poor management decisions.  This is how it starts.
