If you remember your foreign language classes in high school, it is likely not with a smile. The endless conjugation of verbs and repeating vocabulary over and over and over... tedious and not very productive. But Rosetta Stone has solved that.

How does a child learn a new language? Through immersion. Expose a child to a new language, and they will pick it up without ever having to go through the endless practice of German 101. This is Rosetta Stone's secret: it skips the repetitive exercises of the verbs and the simple phrases of the Dick and Jane saw a dog type of learning in favor of an immersive experience into German as if you were dropped in to Berlin without a phrasebook and left to your own devises.

It sounds hard and horrible, but it is not. It is the easiest and fastest way to pickup a new language. If you lived in France and spent a lot of time in Germany, then you would learn the language the same way.

Rosetta Stone allows you to learn at your own pace with this user-friendly software that comes complete with a microphone headset and companion audio CDs that allow you practice when you are without your computer such as driving or working out.
