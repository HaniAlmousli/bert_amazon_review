I didn't notice many things that have changed over the previous version, but it does add support for file formats that weren't previously supported. It's still hard in this day and age to fork over this kind of money for  a word processor when Microsoft and Apple are now giving away theirs for free, but if you've been a fan of WordPerfect in the past, you likely still will be. The comfortable old interface is still here and it still works great. I installed this on my dad's old laptop that just isn't beefy enough to run the fancy new MS Office suite smoothly, which all word processors should do as a minimum. Cross compatibility with other word processors is just fine. I've found it's far more user friendly than the alternatives, especially for those who are new to computing. I have even run it from a flash drive while using computers at work and school, so no complaints here.
