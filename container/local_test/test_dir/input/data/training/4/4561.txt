My small business doesn't require me to do too much with the software beside invoicing clients and keeping track of expenses (I do not have employees and do not have any inventory). Yet this is a really helpful product, however I am still struggling trying to differentiate between what I need and what I don't. It was easy to install and upgrade to, they do have a few features that are at additional costs and it seems that you get a good amount of pop up windows offering other of their services. To be realistic their isn't much out there that can do the same thing quickbooks does and once you master its use it is a great software.
