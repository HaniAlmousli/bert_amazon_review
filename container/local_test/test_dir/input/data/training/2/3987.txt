TurboTax 2007 caused me hours of wasted time. If I hadn't noticed that it didn't deduct what I had entered for section 179 depreciation, then I would have paid thousands more tax. Other people had the same problem based on what I saw on their support forum. I suspect TurboTax 2008 will also have its share of bugs and problems. SO CHECK YOUR RETURN CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU FILE! Also, expect it to nickel and dime you when you want to do a relative's return (or someone else's) after you've done your own. But I'm going to be nice and give them 2 stars because the competition also has its issues.

UPDATE 2008-12-29: Policy has changed and you now get "FREE: 5 federal e-files and unlimited printed returns included with every TurboTax 2008 product." Thanks, Intuit, for listening and responding!

UPDATE 2008-12-30: Product does not say it is compatible with Vista 64-bit, but it seems to be working for me on Vista 64-bit.
