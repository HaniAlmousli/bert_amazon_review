There honestly can be so much that can be said about what makes a great antivirus software. Most of them have made it much harder to keep your computer completely protected under the harshest Trojans and malicious malware. But honestly I have tried antivirus from trusted companies like Norton and McAfee, and the results are really the same. They just are not really keeping your computer completely protected from any of the damage, and do not go deep enough to keep the computer secure. Now, with us using mobile devices like tablets and smartphones, it is much harder to be protected from threats. McAfee's 2016 Internet Security Unlimited Internet Security Software misses the mark, and doesn't work as strongly at keeping your tablets and e-readers protected. It does only work well on computers, but doesn't push it farther. Overall, I would recommend that you do try another antivirus program that works much father like BitDefender, or Vipre overall. They are much more worth the money.
