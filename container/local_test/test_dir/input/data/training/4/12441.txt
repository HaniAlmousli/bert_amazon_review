This product is pretty innovative as it is installed via USB and not cd rom. Keep in mind, to try this product, you must uninstall all other security software. I tried it on a separate laptop in case I wasn't happy with it. The one major thing I liked was that when it was scanning, it didn't affect the other processes in the same way that macafee causes a slow down or momentary freezing of what you're working on otherwise. I think it will be a matter of living with this software for a while before making a final decision on its overall effectiveness and how the renewal process works. In researching, I've noticed that there have been complaints about the product not functioning if it isn't renewed at exactly the due date. I don't know if this is true but it's worth mentioning. I have it marked on my calendar to see when the year is up. Otherwise, it seems to be a good, innovative product with possibilities. As with anything new on the market, time does have a way of showing the glitches and hopefully, the creators will be constantly upgrading the software to move ahead with the times.

I will try to edit my review over time with updates or oddities with the product until the renewal date when I will make a decision whether or not to renew.
