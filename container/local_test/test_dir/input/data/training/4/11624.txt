I've been using this to convert old family videos to a modern format.  It's been working beautifully.  It's powerful with an intuitive user interface...at least if you've previously used similar programs.  I don't know about your old movies, but my thirty year old ones needed a lot of work.  Image stabilization was nonexistent in my earliest cameras and was pretty weak in the later ones.  Exposures were okay when the swim meets were outdoors, but iffy for indoor events,  Magix Movie Edit Pro really helped make those old videos viewable again.  Thanks!
