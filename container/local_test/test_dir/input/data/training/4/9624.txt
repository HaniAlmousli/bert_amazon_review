I was a little unhappy with Norton last year I had purchased Norton 360 in Sept of 2014 and soon after they came out with Norton Security. They provided no way to upgrade so i waited until my time ran out and considered going to another Security Suite.  But I didn't I do like the way this works and I have used Norton for a long time. Folks it works put in a little time and learn how to use it and keep it updated and you will be better off. Amazon provides you the new key and the price is right for the consumer. I will probably reorder next year.
