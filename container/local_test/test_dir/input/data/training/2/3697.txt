I had high hopes for this product.  However, my hopes were dashed immediately after installation.  I installed the program on a fairly new machine running a fresh installation of XP-SP3.  Despite a problem-free installation, I noticed that I lost my Internet connection afterwards.  I discovered this while attempting to activate the program.  The application stated there was a problem with my Internet connection, but didn't realize it was the culprit.  I adjusted the firewall settings until I was able to restore Internet connectivity, however, a non-savvy user might have a harder time figuring out the problem, and they're the ones who need this type of application the most.  The program also displayed a bunch of pop-ups for firewall rules and real-time protection notifications, sometimes several at once.  I quickly opted to operate the firewall in "silent mode", which is supposed to limit notifications and create rules automatically, however, I still received quite a few pop-up notifications before they, thankfully, eventually diminished.  I then tried the update feature.  The update process was simple but it required two successive reboots to complete.

I finally got the program tamed, however, there were still some exisitng issues.  System resource impact wasn't too bad. Web browsing was fast and pages loaded quickly, although it takes quite a bit of time for web access to become available when starting Windows.  I also frequently lost web access and had to restart the browser several times to restore.  I also noticed a few extra seconds delay during startup and shutdown, but nothing alarming.  The scanning and malware engine seems pretty good and fast.  There is no right-click context menu scan, a major flaw.  In other words, no way to manually scan individual files, such as downloads, without scanning the entire system. The interface is otherwise clean with easily reachable menus/sub-menus.  The program can be completely or selectively disabled.

I feel the installation process is too problematic for the average user.  The default firewall settings are too restrictive and all of the initial pop-ups can be pretty confusing and irritating.  I also feel the lack of context-menu scanning and the frequent loss of network connectivity are serious minuses. I would look elsewhere.
