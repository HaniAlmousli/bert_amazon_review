Having used Peach Tree from it's earliest version to it's later more sophisticated version, and later, Quick Books, I've found this software to be favorably comparable. I like the easy directions, the variety of apps available and the simplicity of use.

I have a small business and the inventory app lets me know when an item is sold, giving me a report when I want one that tells me what the status of the inventory is among other important reports on sales, returns, etc. Since a one-of-a-kind inventory item can only be sold once I have previously had trouble keeping customers from trying to order an item that has already been sold. Now, I have a way to control that.

If you are a small business owner and want to be your own bookkeeper, this is the software for you.
