I have taught 5 children to read now, all of which are advanced for their age.  I've used Reader Rabbit and other programs as a fun supplement to the reading book I use. This one is super nice!  It keeps it interesting and laid back, and I am using it for my advanced learner (stage 4 of 4 in the program) along with my beginning reader. And my preschooler can also play with the first level even though I haven't worked with her on actual reading yet. So the value is good for three children.  Content is easy to navigate through and I found it to be very well done.

But now to the cons of the program. First, I thought this was a disc. It's not... Its only 1 year of access to their online program. I found it super expensive. I wanted something I could use for years and OFFLINE. Not something I have to watch to make sure they don't accidentally browse the internet.  They really should offer the software for a one time price.

For those with a limited budget, I suggest Starfall, you can get it on disc for about $15 or use their online program for free. Its not as comprehensive though.

If the cost and online connective don't bother you, then this is a good program. I still think it's expensive so I took off a star for that. I would buy it for this price in a heartbeat if it wasn't a yearly fee. An had unlimited profiles.
