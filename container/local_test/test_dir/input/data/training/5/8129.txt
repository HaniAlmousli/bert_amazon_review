I have had Webroot for the last several years. It works well and the price is quite good compared to others that are similar. Viruses are lurking in the most innocent looking places, unfortunately.  One simply cannot be without an Internet Security program, and I use the Internet for work as well .At this price, peace of mind is very affordable. I wish the installation process were a little simpler, but then again, I am not tech minded. I have tried other programs and this one is the best for the money.
