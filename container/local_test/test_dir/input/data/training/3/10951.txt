If you are comfortable with Office 2013 (or Office 2010 or even Office 2007) and don't need Microsoft's touted collaboration features then I can't see any truly compelling reason to recommend this upgrade.

In fact, I don't think Microsoft really feels any reason to promote this product either. This edition of the 2016 Office suite has Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, and OneNote, but it doesn't have Publisher and Access; you have to subscribe to Office365 to get these. And that's where it seems Microsoft really wants to push you. Even if you don't find the app differential too big, the number of devices you can install on should point out that annual subscriptions are the future (Microsoft being only one player of thousands who want to keep their fingers in your wallet). While I understand the benefit of having this Product Key tied to your Microsoft account (theoretically allowing you to move Office to another computer) I have generally preferred tying the installation to a machine. At a "philosophical level" I find myself strongly resistant to this pull (or push) to move the nexus of control from the user to the software owner. I get all the anti-piracy, EULA stuff, but each day makes me feel more like a drone of Microsoft or Apple, or whomever/whatever. I'm no longer an independent operator; I'm some corporation's node....

Okay, enough editorializing. Back to the item at hand. Installation was relatively straight-forward; log in (or sign up) at the Microsoft site, enter the Product Key, sort through several options, and watch the installation begin. No problem whatsoever. The apps were ready to be used about 10 minutes in, but full installation took about 30 minutes. From then on it's like using Office 2013 (I'm one of those "average users" who really don't use the collaboration or other behind-the-scenes features that make Office 2016 supposedly better and worth the cash layout).

3 stars. Nothing special for me here. Don't believe most folks will find anything special here either. I guess if you need Office and don't currently have it you could buy this. Personally I'd buy Office 2010 or Office 2013. I also recommend the Open Source (that is, free) LibreOffice suite and even Corel's WordPerfect suite. And from a costs-features perspective you might find Office365 a better deal. In the end I guess it comes down to whether you need to produce a document (or spreadsheet or presentation) or be connected. I continue to try to resist being connected. Your choice may be different....
