I'm in the process of updating a will, so was looking forward to using this as a starting point, leaving only the final review to my attorney.

In practice, I found it impossible to get what I wanted that way. Instead, I ended up just manually editing my existing will with a word processor.

If you've never created a will, living will, or durable power of attorney, this software gives you a starting point for your thinking, and helps make sure you don't skip important steps.

However, don't expect your attorney to thank you. Several attorneys I know went out of their way at a recent estate workshop I helped pilot at our church to tell me this is a waste of time, and wouldn't help them meet my needs more efficiently at all. I realize this could be seen as just protecting their turf, but at least one is a good enough friend that I know it's his honest opinion.
