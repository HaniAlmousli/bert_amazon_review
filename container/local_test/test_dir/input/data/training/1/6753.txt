Update September 2016 Corel ha dropped support for this . It WILL NOT INSTALL as of now .  Requires software that no longer exits as part of the installation process. Upgrading to Windows 10 Update generates error message about re-installing the software. This was a 5 star program . I've changed my rating to 1 star because I can't give it a 0 .

That said don't expect speed or ease of use at these specifications. If you only meet the minimum requirements you might be better off trying&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/VideoStudio-Pro-X5-Ultimate/dp/B007GFNPFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">VideoStudio Pro X5 Ultimate</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cyberlink-PowerDirector-11-Ultra/dp/B009716GWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cyberlink PowerDirector 11 Ultra</a>. Of the two I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/VideoStudio-Pro-X5-Ultimate/dp/B007GFNPFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">VideoStudio Pro X5 Ultimate</a>&nbsp;as the more stable program. Another PC based alternative is&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sony-Movie-Studio-Platinum-Suite-12/dp/B008MIMIY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sony Movie Studio Platinum Suite 12</a>.
 Regardless of the software you choose , keep in mind the more memory , larger the hard drive and your video card will determine performance.

As with all video software there is a learning curve to each of these products and I didn't necessarily find one harder to learn than another.

On the other hand if you need to replace your computer to run this software you might be better served by switching to a Mac and going the Final Cut route to editing.
