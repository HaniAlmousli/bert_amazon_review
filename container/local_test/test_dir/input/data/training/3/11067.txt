PSP X8 Ultimate was just fine...until X9 was released. Like most other users I now receive nags daily to upgrade X8 to the newest version. I have done everything I can think of (and every remedy others have Googled) to terminate these annoying upgrade solicitations from Corel. I've unchecked both boxes provided in X8's "communications preferences" submenu (in the program's help page), and I have expressly requested Corel in the company's privacy settings section for my account, to cease sending notices pertaining to upgrades, fixes, etc., -- all to no avail. I've utilized W Windows 10's notifications options in my effort to prevent these nag ads from appearing on my screen -- but nothing seems able to end these unwanted intrusions. I guess all that's left is to delete PSP X8 and all references to Corel in the Registry -- and end a very long-standing relationship with that company.
