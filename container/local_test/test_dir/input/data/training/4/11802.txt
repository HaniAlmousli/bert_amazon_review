I have used this product since 1996. I like it because it remembers my information from year to year, like depreciation, losses, IRAs, investment accounts, Schedule C, auto & other expenses, etc. This year the price was right to move to the Premier Version. I found data entry could be very annoying in the lesser versions. It was always trying to sell you a better version. That means it was also stupid on top of annoying! If I wanted a better one, I would have bought that.

This is better than it was with some inefficiencies like: to jump back into a section, like "Income" or "Deductions" you have to revisit a bunch of questions you already answered in that section. You should be able to "drill down" to where you want to continue. I like the forms section that you can choose to use.

I continue to use it because there's nothing that adequately competes with it on the market. It gets the job done. It's reasonably priced; although, I always try to buy this program on sale. I also know that it's only a limited amount of time that I have to devote to using it.

Still, unlike previous years, there are no hidden fees. I paid for the Fed & State and got them. The eFile for Federal was free! It can also be used for several returns. Money talks!
