I have only used an earlier version of MapPoint and even then for only in a strictly direction-finding capacity. I understood the data mapping functionality of the product but that was never a feature I intended to use. MapPoint 2009 seems to go one better than that earlier version in refining both those features I like and use (ie. direction and route finding) and those which I have less use of.

From a usability standpoint, this interface is intuitive and easy-to-use. For me, there were no problems with moving around the map interface and zooming in to whatever I was interested with either the mouse or keyboard. The various features for route planning is as good as any other on the market today and as this is my primary focus, I'm functionally happy with MapPoint 2009. With the "optimize trip", MapPoint 2009 helps me make the best use of my time, especially when I am geocaching when I have to hit caches in several different areas. In that regard, I find it handles off-road situations rather poorly, but that's understandable. With features like being able to create what they call a "Drivetime Zone", you can find subtle and cool ways to use your maps. Drivetime Zones will select and show you what you can reach within a set amount of time from a particular center point.

Export and import of data is simple and easy with the Import Data Wizard that automatically understands what kind of data  you're importing (of course, if it contains addresses!) and then sorting graphically for data. Having direct, in-program access to demographic information must make Real Estate agents drool in analyzing their information. Using the Data Mapping Wizard (love those wizards, don't you?) makes doing such things easy.
I particularly like the ability to insert maps into other Microsoft products, especially the Office suite such as (especially) PowerPoint presentations. I'm going to give this product four stars because I think it should include at least a simple GPS device for the price.
