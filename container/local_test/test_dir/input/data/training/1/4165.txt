I was really disappointed by this software.  I had used PrintMaster products for many years.  I tried this version and it is very large (takes up a ton of space), the graphics and clip art are not great.  With Google Images nowadays, it's pretty easy to find the art you need and you don't need to take up 20+GB of hard drive space storing clip art.  I really found this version of the software unusable. I hope they improve the next version.
