You put the call-in line of your local rock station on speed dial on your office phone, cell, and your vacationing cube-mate.  Every time you hear the magic tone, you jump and try, try to be the 95th caller.  Finally, it happens-and you have an "All Access" pass to see Springstein!  You arrive at the concert, and find out that "All Access" means third row, far, far right, obstructed view...no jamming with the Boss tonight!

That's how you'll feel if you buy McAfee's All Access protection.  All Access, except for iPads, Macs, and all but one of your computers (most virus programs are licensed for three computers).

Incidentally the program works fine, although (like other McAfee products) there is too much in the way of pop-ups reminding me that the virus definitions have been updated.  I give it two stars because of the high pricing and that the "All Access" is basically an empty phrase.
