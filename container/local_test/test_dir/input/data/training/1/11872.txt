I have used Turbotax Deluxe for years. This year I cannot update seven files to get rid of the "Do Not File" note at the top of the forms. In fact I cannot file until these files are updated. I spend an hour on the phone with tech support. They finally gave me a new download. I installed it and have the same problem. It doesn't work well with El Capitan operating system. I hate to go to H&R Block but I am totally frustrated.
