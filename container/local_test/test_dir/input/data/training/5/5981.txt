I haven't even used the full capacity of the Corel PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate software and consider it to be fantastic.  My mother took thousands of photos over the years as a hobby.  Those photos captured the lives of our entire family, our vacations, our home, all the fun times and some of the hard times.  All those pictures were stored on 35 mm slides and photo paper.  There were boxes of pictures.  When she passed away one of my brothers undertook the job of converting all those photos to digital and placing them on DVD disks. When I got my copy of the first disk I was happy but disappointed in the quality of the converted pictures.  They were not sorted in any way, so there were pictures of a summer vacation mixed in with snowstorm pictures.  I used the Corel software to clean up the pictures and sorted them into catagories.  I was surprised at how nice they were after the Corel Paintshop application.  There are also some nice free things included with the software and I intend to take advantage of them.  Especially, they offer a free Blurb(R) photo book and a copy of WinZip (R) Pro.  This software does so much I know I will be learning and enjoying it for some time.  I think everyone will enjoy working with it too.
