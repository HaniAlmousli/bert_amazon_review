In my opinion, the main reason for this upgrade was to make money for Apple and its partners that were hurting with the bad economy.  I don't believe the hype about having to sync it with iPads and iPhones. To me, the operating system is now officially junk. For extremely little gain you put up with endless hours of grief typical of older Apple OS problems in the OS 9 days.  I upgraded because Apple was getting rid of "me.com" and replacing it with iCloud, which I could care less about.  Os Lion was required to do that.  Pretty sneaky if you ask me. Of course Lion broke numerous software titles, not the least of which was Passwords Plus which held all my life's passwords.  At this time, that one can't be fixed even with DataViz's import program, which transfers the data to an insecure Excel document (if it had worked). This alone shows the incredible fallibility of putting passwords and bank accounts into computer programs. It's just not safe.  The woman next to me at the Apple store tried to rely on Apples TimeMachine backup to restore her computer, but it failed under Lion.  So nothing is safe around a Lion! I should have known..

Lion also broke Business Card Composer, Photoshop and other critical programs. This of course helps Apple, which charged me to go to iPhoto 11 so it could work with iCloud as well as its partners as I spend hundreds of dollars and numerous hours to upgrade applications that Lion broke. All for what, "gestures?" and other hardly worth it gimmicks?  Apple is definitely a pirate of Silicon Valley.  It pushes around its trapped customers today, just as much as it always has.  Pretty soon we'll have Mountain Lion.  I was perfectly happy with Me.com and my old OS leopard and all my applications. Apple is just another monopoly taking advantage of its trapped audience.  I don't like 'em and now that Jobs is gone, I wouldn't trust Apple, Inc. further than I can throw a stick.  Never trust any  99 cent company.  i.e. $499 vs $500 for an iPad.  Tricky on the outside always means tricky on the inside. Just another dirt-bag corporation.

By the way, the "download only" idea stank to high heaven.  It took forever, crashed and I had to go to the Apple Store to fix it.  I feel for folks that don't have an Apple store nearby that got stuck with that horrendous problem.  This was almost as bad as using AT&T as the iPhone's sole service provider.

What a mess Apple.  Thank you for nothing.  Get a moral bearing and those of us that are not blind lemmings might also learn to like you.
