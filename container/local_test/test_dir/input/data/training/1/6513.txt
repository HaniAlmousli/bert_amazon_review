I am looking to replace quickbooks pro.  I would really love to replace quickbooks pro. I wish their was something available that would. I was hoping this new Sage 50 Complete was a viable replacement. However it seems that Peachtree has been bought out and Sage has turned the product in to some sort of subscription based accounting software.

You will be spending much more money than the initial $200 to get started fee. At least $250 or more annually. If they had taken a similar approach to the ink jet printer market they would have offered the program for $50 and then made you shell out more to continue. However the up front cost plus the high subscription fees make this a ridiculous purchase. I will not be continuing down this path. If you have peachtree, don't upgrade unless you have to and are prepared too. If you are on quickbooks, stay on quickbooks. Make sure you know full about what you are getting in to with this Sage program. It is an accounting program that adds to their bottom line, not yours.

1 star ridiculous.
