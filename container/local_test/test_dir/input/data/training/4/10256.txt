First off, this program (or others like it) is probably responsible for most of the horrible "art" you see on the internet. Where people do stupid things to stupid pictures and declare it art.  So what is it good for?  Surprisingly, it is excellent for an author who needs to illustrate but does not have illustration skills.

Let me get through the basics first. The program can do MOST of what the full version of Painter can do, it is just packaged into a slightly dumbed down, slightly limited and largely simplified menu system.  But if you dig in deep, much of the full Painter program is there.  At least the functions, maybe not all of the organization tools.

Most of what you can do, you shouldn't do. It can take a good photo and make it look bad. It can take a bad photo and make it look worse. BUT, with some careful work, you can take photos and turn them into abstract or impressionist images that actually look like illustrations.  A great example can be found in Jaime Moreno's excellent video review.  He has a picture of a train track which has been turned into an excellent illustration for a book of a train coming towards the reader. This would be a decent illustration in almost any book, especially a children's book.

If you are an aspiring author and feel like you need some basic illustrations then this program could make it pretty easy for you to take pictures of what you need and quickly turn them in to acceptable illustrations for your book.

I would also add that they tools are very well done, especially things like resizing the brushes which everyone should learn from their method here! Much faster, easier and intuitive that PS and others.

Another reviewer says that teens enjoy this program. I would go further and say that my 6 and 7 year olds have a blast with it too.  So it is excellent for kids as well.

If you don't need this, then you don't need it. If you think you do, get the trial version, it is 100% enabled and you can check it out for 30 days.  But for what it does, I'm not sure there is anything out there that is leaps and bounds better. If there is, someone please direct me in the comments - I would like to check it out.

I will give an honorable mention to Autodesk SketchBook Pro 7, which is also a very good program and very stripped down and streamlined for easy of use.  I hope this has helped.
