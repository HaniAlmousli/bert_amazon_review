Quickbooks is still the best out there for small business. Even though the online companies are trying, they aren't there yet.  To bad they can't make this work for a MAC the same way.

We purchased the upgrade and had problems converting files to TurboTax, so we went back to an accountant.

The new interface is easier to use and the auto bill features work great if you offer monthly services.  Will I buy the next version?  We'll see if it is MAC ready or if the online guys catch up.  I do like my data on my computers though.....
