I believed the hype from Microsoft that Windows 7 was 'better' or 'fixed', 'more stable' ... whatever, so I bought it. First it is sooooo different from XP that it is difficult to navigate. I had to search the internet for instructions to do the simplest of tasks.

I've been running 7 for about 3 or 4 months. I get a blue screen of death about every week or two. The most recent example was yesterday morning. I started to upload a youtube video, went away to have breakfast and came back to a blue screen of death. It's not like I was doing anything complicated, just one IE window open and one upload happening. I'm so disappointed.

Speaking of Internet Explorer, it crashes more than in XP. It just stops working, dims, shows that it's thinking and won't let you do anything for minutes. A company that can not even get a web browser to work right has no business selling an operating system. It's time to upgrade to Firefox.

XP is pretty good. I use that at work everyday. I bought a laptop with Vista. That sucked soooooo bad that I ditched Vista completely and installed Ubuntu. I've had no problems with Ubuntu. I'm going to upgrade to Ubuntu on my desktop(the one with Windows 7 on it now). I will also never be purchasing another Microsoft product, hardware or software. I can't financially support a company that charges for such crappy products.

Ubuntu and Firefox are where it's at.
