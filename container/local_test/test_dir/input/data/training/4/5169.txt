The program was easy to install, and started up just fine.

You are able to edit photos easily.  You can also adjust lighting.  Red eye and facial photos adjustments are possible both automatic and manual.

You are able to save or replace photos.

You can make cards and photo albums with themes.

You can do slide shows and add music.

That's all I've been able to do.  I was not able to use the moviemaker yet.

Everything worked as well as my other photo editing software except for the rubber stamp.  The rubber stamp in this program was mediocre.  Didn't work well.  Didn't blend well.  Was like a toy for kids, and had no adjustments.
