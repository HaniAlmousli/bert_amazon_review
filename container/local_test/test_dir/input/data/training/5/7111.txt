I've used this TurboTax version for as long as e-filing has been available. It really makes the yearly federal and state income tax filing about as easy as it can be.  The program makes improvements in usability and filing procedures with each iteration.
That said, the program doesn't do everything: the user MUST keep good records.  If you don't have the information and understand how to enter it -- the latter is pretty simple now -- no tax program or human tax preparer can help you.  You must learn what to keep and how to keep it so that you can find it easily at tax filing time. That's the key.
I've never been aware of any errors that TurboTax has made compiling my taxes.  The federal e-filing is simple and fast.  My state has a rather strange and awkward free e-filing service based on .pdf forms that you fill in manually (really!) from the data calculated by TurboTax.  Maybe the $19.95 upcharge for TurboTax's state e-file service is worth it.
