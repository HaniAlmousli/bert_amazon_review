I used Quicken Legal Buiness Pro for my own small online business last year. It really helped out in a few areas. The biggest was documents! I could finally  get my own documents and print them right out without the help of an attorney or accountant. It certainly saved me here and there! It is certainly easy to use and gives a prompt showing the legal in's and out's as you go along.  As always, if in doubt, contact your own attorney for advice.  I would buy this again just to save myself the time and money.
