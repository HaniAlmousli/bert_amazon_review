Yes there are still some minor bugs that undoubtedly will get fixed but this year's edition boasts the most perfect, elegant combination of interface simplicity, intuitiveness & functionality I have ever experienced in a Turbotax product. Note to Intuit - no more interface improvements needed - it's perfect! Just repeat next year & the year after, etc. please.
