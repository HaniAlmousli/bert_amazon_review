It's gotten more stable over time but still not as feature rich or reliable as the windows version.  Office 365 isn't a bad value if you have more than one computer before getting this.

I love OS X but Office is essential for me.  Parallels software to run windows Office isn't so essential for me now but I still need other windows programs.

Highly recommend for Mac users especially for Word, Powerpoint, and Excel.  I don't use Outlook anymore.  OneNote I've never used.
