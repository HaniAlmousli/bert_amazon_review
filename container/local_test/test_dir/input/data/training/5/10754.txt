So thankful I can read my Kindle books outside of the Kindle. This one for PC works well, is intuitive and handy. Wherever I leave off on either my Kindle or iPad, this application automatically detects and gives me the option to catch up. Well done and easy to use. Easy to read, too. Easily customized just enough to matter.
