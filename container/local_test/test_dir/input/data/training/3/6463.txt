I hate to say it, but this is not as good as MS.  It is a good basic word processor and spreadsheet program, but then again, so is Libre Office (which is free).  I actually find WordPerfect Office very similar to the Libre Office product.  In general there seems to be more features and functionality in the MS Office suite than Corel's Office Suite.  Although this may be because I am not used to the product, having used MS Office for the past 20 years.

I used MS Office at work and thought Corel would be a less expensive alternative when I had to bring some work home.  It has not worked out that way.  You lose much of the formatting when you convert from MS to Corel and visa-versa.

If you plan to use this product as a stand-alone program, then it should work fine for you.  But if you plan to share files with others running MS Office, it will be a problem.  Overall, I brought this when it was a gold box special for $20, so I did not lose much.
