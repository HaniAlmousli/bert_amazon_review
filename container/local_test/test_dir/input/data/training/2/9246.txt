I've been using Norton for most of the years I've owned computers. I had 360 until I installed this new package. Plain and simple, I miss 360 and its features, such as the file and registry clean-up utilities. But I can live without those.

My biggest complaint? It keeps crashing in Google Chrome. I don't feel fully protected. I get regular messages of "This plug-in has quit working. Do you want to stop it?" or "Norton has crashed. Reload page?" SEVERAL TIMES a day. When I am working or playing or just whatever. It has also slowed down my Chrome page loading times. So no, I am not a happy Norton user and will probably uninstall this and buy 360 despite this version being free to me for a year for my honest review.

It reloads fairly quickly--or appears to--then it crashes again a few minutes later. I am using it on two different computers--a desktop PC and a laptop PC and it does this on both devices. I am wary. I don't feel safe. I am NOT inclined to try the password vault feature after all of that. Which doesn't lead me to recommend the product.

I'll give two stars because I like the concept of covering all the devices I use, but after using it on two, I won't be loading it onto the rest. Yuck.

To be fair, the system caught a bad app from messing with my computer after a rare bad app kerfuffle-I usually avoid those myself with internet savvy but this one got through--shortly after installation. Another reason I am sticking with the two stars. It saved my cookies once. But it's made me lose lots of minutes everyday since then.
