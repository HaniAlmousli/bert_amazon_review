My wife has been struggling with the accounting for her business for a while; she understands the basic accounting concepts (she's taken classes) but hasn't been able to find a good program that does everything she needs it to do and is affordable. We were lucky enough to receive Sage 50 Premium Accounting 2014  (3-User) and she absolutely loves it! The interface is easy to use, the way everything is set up is pretty intuitive, and it more than meets her needs.

Her one objection to this software is the auto-renewal feature. It's always annoying when companies do this. In this particular case, you have to provide your credit card information in order to get the thing started. If you forget to cancel at the end of the year, you're in for a big surprise... and not a happy one.
