I didn't have any major problems installing this software.  The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem.  I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version.  Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.  I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.  If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.  Can't get easier than that!
