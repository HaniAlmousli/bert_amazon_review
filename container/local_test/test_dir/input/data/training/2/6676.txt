I was perfectly happy with Quicken 2012 but when I saw that 2013 had an iPad app I had to take the plunge. Throughout my day, I spend a lot of pocket cash that I often forget about, and the idea of being able to enter transactions directly on my iPad and then sync them when I got home was *very* appealing to me since I'd often end a month with a few hundred dollars in "pocket cash" when my wallet only had $20 in it.

However, the cloud experience just flat out does not work. I added all of my accounts, but when I log into the iPad App it tells me to go to my computer and add the accounts. I've tried cloud sync several times. After about 5 minutes, a window pops up that "Quicken has stopped responding" with options to close the program or continue waiting. I picked "Continue" then took my dogs for a walk, only to return 20 minutes later to the same message and I have a *VERY* fast Internet connection (it took about 1 minute to download the Quicken program itself).

After doing some research on the web, I saw that a lot of users were not only having trouble with the iPad app, but were LOSING DATA. This thought terrifies me, so I temporarily turned off cloud sync.

As for the rest of the app, nothing really new and exciting. It does what Quicken is supposed to do.

I'm giving it two stars because the basic app itself is functional, but I feel Intuit has really misled the consumer into upgrading with the idea of a cloud-based iPad app when this app isn't working properly.
