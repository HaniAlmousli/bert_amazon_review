I installed the product on a Mac OS 10.8.2 machine.  The software installed easily with no problems observed. Before testing I installed the latest software update.  The software worked without problems and handled everything I tried without error messages or instability issues.  The interface has changed somewhat and some may not like it .  After using it a couple of weeks I really like it.  Highly recommended
