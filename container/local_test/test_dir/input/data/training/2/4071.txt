I cannot recommend this product.  The performance is bad on my Quad Core, 8GB, 64 bit system and feature set is too light

Corel has done a nice job providing a clean interface that is shared across the prodcut set. The software will index your images and videos on your computer when it work.  I pointed the software to my images folder and it failed to add about half of the subfolders. You create slideshows and videos, the burn to a DVD that you can send to your family.  The photo editing options are pathetic. (Sepia / B&W and little else)

Corel had really butchered the Ulead product line.  Yes these are the express version of the main productss but there is just not enough features to justify paying more than $30 for this prouduct. You are better going with the Adobe Photoshop Elements / Adobe Premiere Elements or using free products.  Google has done a great job with Picasa by the way..
