I needed some simple switches not too long ago to place in low volume traffic areas.  A prime concern was price, and these fit the bill quite nicely.

Although there are only three connections to the switches that I placed, they are expected to handle some rather large transfers at times - they are connected to networked printers in the premises, as well as to a networked copy controller.  I have not seen any issues with them since their installation, and they look decent enough to not cause any raised eyebrows when they are in plain sight.  Time will obviously tell how well they last, but considering that a similarly placed "name brand" switch recently gave up the ghost after 8 months, these have more than paid for themselves by now.
