Garmin needs to realize that most GPS units no longer sell for $500+. I used to update my maps every year on my modest Street Pilot C330, but it no longer makes any sense. I can sell it on eBay and pick up a new unit, with new maps, for less than what Garmin sells their map updates. $50+ for a map update might have been reasonable a few years ago, but GPS prices are a fraction of what they once were. Map update prices have pretty much stayed the same though. Very little changes in these updates each year too. Until Garmin gets realistic with their update pricing, I'll just pick up a new $100 unit every year or two, and sell the old one.
