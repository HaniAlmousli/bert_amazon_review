Norton's protection software is commonly used to protect your computer against the latest threats, keep your online identity safe, defend against hackers, and it promises that it won't slow down your Mac. I was very excited to use this product, but upon inserting it into my Mac I was told it would not work with my model. Unfortunately I was unable to use the software. If there's a problem with the packaging, it's that this valuable piece of information is printed too small. Sure, it's there for people to read, but it need to be more prevalent on the packaging.

Other than that I've had no hands on experience with the software. While I've heard that it's very good, I personally am unable to say.
