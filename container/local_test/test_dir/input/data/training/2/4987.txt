Watch out, don't let the name deceive you.  Although Quickbooks is a wonderful package on the PC, this Mac version is awful especially considering the price.  If it were selling for 75% less, I would still slam it but at the price offered here and everywhere, it's an embarrassment.

The worst part for me was the difficulty in money account transfers.  What's the deal here. I had software from the 1990s that could do this efficiently.  The PC version doesn't have any problem with it.
