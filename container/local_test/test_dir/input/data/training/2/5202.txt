GUEST REVIEWER  ! MRS KNOW IT ALL ;b

This software package gives you a lot more for your money.  AVG internet security 2011 software will protect your PC from malware, malicious sites, spam filtering and not tax your computers speed.  The best part is that this software includes free identity theft recovery service and a PC tune-up utility (free one-time usage, then you have to pay).  I like the ability to at least be able to see what the tune-up utility will find----then I can run it once and then look FREE software to do the same trick.  The things I don't like about this software is that this software is not that good at removing detected malware, antiphishing is not that accurate, and the sets can be complicated to set up.  I don't think I could trust this product to give the full protection I need, so I am going to pass.
