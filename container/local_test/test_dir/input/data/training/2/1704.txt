Hello,In a word WEAK...Less than a week my laptop was infected with the dreaded synaptic virus knocking out the touch pad driver. Then when I logged in at home,I found that my laptop was infected with spyware. Live One didn't not deliver either time. Only thing that live one did that wasn't already built in to the OS was take my credit card for $49.99. Wait how about DUMB AS A ROCK...no that's three words.
