Avanquest is one of the worst software companies I have ever encountered. They sell buggy software, refuse to acknowledge any problems, they will ignore your letters and then want you to pay for upgrades. I got conned by their hype and bought a couple of their products. By the time I realized how buggy the software was, it was too late to return them. Then I get an email which essentially said I could buy a new version that might fix the bugs. Why should I have to pay for something to fix the bugs? I emailed them repeatedly and they did a great job of ignoring me and repeatedly asking what the problem was, I then realized they were just laughing at me.
