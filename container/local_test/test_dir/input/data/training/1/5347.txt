Wow- OK, I admit that my comparison of online/digital language courses is being compared to Rosetta Stone, but as an educator in general, this program is awful. They teach you words at random (not in word sets), verbs are non existent in the beginning phases, and the voices and illustrations (not photos) are boring (very elementary in drawing style). For $30 you are paying them tp package and ship this junk to you... not to learn a language. If you are looking to truly learn a language in a natural, tested, setting online/digitally I would strongly recommend the Rosetta Stone series. I learned more in an hour trial version of Rosetta Stone than in an excruciating hour of this one. This product is very much NOT recommended for beginners or for anyone who wants to learn Spanish or any other language.
