Ancsstry.com has put on the market a software upgrade that is anything but - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN FTW 2014 if you have any intention of working on-line and uploading your data to the black hole of Calcutta. You risk losing all your hard-won insight into your family ancestry, as the software has more glitches than the B-24 in WWII or the Boeing 787 of today. The "sync" function is a time trap and effort-waster, and the fixes proposed do not work. The lines are always busy when you call for help, and even if you get through, the operators are more interested in reading their scripts from the screen in front of them than in finding a solution.

Ancestry is aware of the problem - but keeps right on selling this trash code, gathering in the $$$ and laughing at the suckers who fall for the idea that a firm in Provo, Utah couldn't possibly be so evil as to take money under false pretenses.

I have used FTM for more than 10 years, and while there were troubles at times, they were minor, and fixes quickly made. Not now. And not again will I buy something from ancestry.com without a written guarantee that the program has been thoroughly tested, and - more importantly - that even if I drop my subscription to ancestry, which is more than $200 a year for full data, any data links to source material will still be valid.

Beware the Provo bandits!
