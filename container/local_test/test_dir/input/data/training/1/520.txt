I hate to be harsh to products, esp. since I was a huge fan of Norton Utilities back in the late 80s/early 90s.  But over the last couple of years I've been disappointed at many Symantec products, which seem more guided by greed than anything else.  Peter Norton, where are you?
NSW 2003 continues the tradition of bloatware (lots of files and components, many surreptitiously loaded into your system at runtime even if you don't want them), dangerware (my Windows 2000 laptop went kaput after running WinDoctor and I had to reformat the hard drive), and ripping off the loyal customer (no upgrades from previous versions, as Richard Clayton clearly noted).
If you run Windows 2000 and esp. XP, you already have all the tools to help you diagnose your system and keep it running (except anti-virus).  In fact those tools, while not as fancy-looking as NSW, does a much better job and are infinitely more stable.  Also, your PC vendor might have given you other free tools like an anti-virus program, which is probably just as good as NAV.  If you have Windows 98 or earlier, NSW will very likely crash your system rather than keeping it error-free.  I recommend you upgrade to Windows XP, or find a better utility program.
