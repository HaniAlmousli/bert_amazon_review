This is supposed to be along the lines of "Streets and Trips", I guess (a very good program in past iterations), but the specific features and tools are oriented for those who will use it in business, i.e. sales professionals. I'm not a salesman, so I'm reviewing the program only from the standpoint of a personal user- someone who would use it as GPS software on the road, or for planning a vacation. From that perspective (and as others have said), it seems a bit overpriced, and many of the features are unnecessary if that's the intended application. As map-and-GPS-software, however, it performs well, runs consistently, doesn't seem to have any technical bugs, and so forth. I suppose the question for potential buyers, then, is whether the additional features, like being able to mark and label different sections of sales routes, is worth the money. For me, it isn't, but I can definitely see how those extra features can be useful and valuable to someone who would use this for their business.
