I have over a dozen website at MSN communities, 1 at Angelfire and 1 at Bravenet, and they have improved 1000% since getting this program.  I now make my own splash pages, edit, creating everything and anything.
Simple to use, and with an easy step by step manual for both paint shop and animation shop, you will be doing animations, backgrounds, web sets in more in no time at all.
There is PSP addictions rampant in MSN communities - everyone loves this program - and the creativity is wonderful to be a part of.  There are many teaching sites there that help you work with PSP.  I have recommended many people to try the free 30 day download of this item and everyone that has tried it buys it.
When you buy it, get it here, they often have promotions that bring the price down ridiculously low.
WORTH EVERY PENNY!!
