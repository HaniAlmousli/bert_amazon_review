I am not a design pro, I don't have a lot of experience with other software of this type (successfully, at least) but I'm just not that impressed.  Here's why:

1) Installation took over an hour.  It's 4 disks, 4 programs, and 4 long winded serial numbers to enter correctly.  It's a pain.
2) Once installed, this still does not act like a "suite".  There are 4 different programs you have to find and learn to use. You can't quickly and easily move between the programs.  Another pain.
3) It's pretty limited.  I'm more familiar with Google's Picassa for manipulating photos, the one thing I do a lot of, as I use photos in blogs and websites.  I find myself still resorting to the free software to accomplish the basics because this software is such a pain to figure out how to use.  I just want to crop, sometimes increase shadows, add a watermark, and reduce the resolution to post them on the net.  That isn't a quick few clicks with this software, and I never have figured out how to add a watermark.
4) My partner has voiced complaints that it has duplicated photos and done some other weird stuff to the computer its installed on, resulting in excessive number of duplicate files.  It automatically wants to snatch up any images, and creates additional work in terms of just getting the job done.

The plus side?  It's kind of fun to play with.  I may create some digital scrapbooks for my granddaughter.  The "paint" portion is real limited, and the results are usually far from wonderful, so it's just a 'toy'.  It's almost like a sampler of digital imaging software in a simplistic form.  At least I could figure out some stuff on my own, whereas with the programs pros prefer, I was incapable of doing much of anything.

Who would like this software?  Someone who likes playing with their photos and doing digital scrapbooking or creating material for a traditional scrapbook.  Teens and young moms will probably find it more to their tastes.  For us "grandma geek" sorts, it's a bit too complicated for quick & easy use, and too simplistic to devote a lot of time learning to use it.  I'd rate it as "okay" but nothing too exciting.  It can do more than Picassa, for example, which is nice, but for the simple tasks of just managing photos and posting them to the internet, it's a bit too bloated.  I don't hate it, and I'll continue playing with it, but I'm not instantly in love either.
