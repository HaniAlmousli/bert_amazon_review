To test features of the new Dragon Dictate for Mac, I decided to dictate this entire review using the program. Any typos or mistakes in the review is a result of the program and not my typing. I used a previous dictation software in the early 2000s and was less than impressed with its ability to accurately type what I was saying. I thought it was time to give dictation software another try. The package comes with the install software, a quick start guide, and a USB microphone. The install took 2.3 GB of disk space. The system requirements are fairly hefty so make sure your computer can tow the line.  My test compute was a MacBook Pro with 8 GB of memory and a 2.4 GHz Intel core I five processor. After the installation, you will create a profile. You will then go through voice training where you will read a story and the software will get used to your voice. After voice training, you will run through very useful tutorial which has a series of lessons to help you learn the intricacies of the software.
I was very impressed on how quickly it typed what you said. In my testing and along with this review my accuracy was close to 98%. This percentage is much better than I would get if I were typing.

The Nuance website has a number of helpful videos to help you get started in your dictation. While in command mode, you can view a list of all the things that you can say. I found this very helpful.  You can also add your own commands. The program is very easy to use, however, it will take me a while to fully utilize all its capabilities. You can also go to the Nuance website and add extensions for both Safari and Firefox.

The software was very stable. You can also use the software to transcribe an audio recording. I had no problems learning the basic voice commands. My days of hunting and pecking on the keyboard will be fewer and fewer.
