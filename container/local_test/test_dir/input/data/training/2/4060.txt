While Corel Digital Studio 2010 will eventually allow you to do some video editing, DVD authoring, etc. what you end up with is not worth the journey. There is freeware available for each of the tasks that the suit covers that do a better job. The photo suit is useless. Once you manage to get your photos imported you no more functionality then Windows "Paint". After 20-yoars of teaching video editing, I thought I had seen it all when it comes to editing software, but this thing takes the cake. It has limited features, poor interface and is very hard to navigate. It will work, but why use something that is hard to use when the finished product is no better then Windows "Movie Maker". This suit is not worth the money.
