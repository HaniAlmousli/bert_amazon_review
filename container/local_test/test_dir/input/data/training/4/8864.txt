Unless there are some pretty radical changes in my file administration needs (and personal philosophy) the only intended use I have for this software is unzipping RAR files and occasionally, conversion to a PDF.  There might arise some instances where I want to compress for attachment to an email, but not all that likely either.  I suppose there is justification to adding watermarks to photos, if I ever make a practice of uploading photos to some sharing site.

If there is an interest in, or requirement for, encryption of certain files for added security the capability is here and relatively easy to implement.  Files may also be compressed for backup storage but with the abundance of relatively inexpensive high capacity drives, I don't have a need for that functionality either. The learning curve for this utility shouldnt be all that taxing users accustomed to Office style ribbon menuing interfaces or users who regularly share files via social media sites or store in a cloud service.

Essentially, this is a suite of utilities that may have considerate value for users with wider range of requirements who do not desire to use a separate program even if in many instances those individualized lower cost (or free)  apps may be more efficient or focused on a specific demand.
