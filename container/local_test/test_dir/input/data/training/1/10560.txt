I have used TurboTax for at least 25 years and it has served me well - until I filled out my 2014 taxes.  So what changed (other than the unconscionable increase in price)?  Well in 2014 TurboTax suddenly discovered that it had been incorrectly calculating depreciation on foreign rental properties.  Instead of using a 40 year life the software used a 27.5 year life, which only applies to properties located within the US.  This occurred year after year despite the fact that TurboTax explicitly asked if the property was located in a foreign country, to which I always checked the "Yes" box.

Because of this flaw all of my tax returns going back to 2005 had incorrectly claimed too much depreciation on my Canadian rental property, thereby requiring me to file a complicated Form 3115 to request a change in accounting convention.  Furthermore, I have to report extra income over the next four years so the IRS can recover the excess depreciation I took.  This, in turn, pushed me into a higher tax category and increased the amounts I will have to pay in Medicare premiums.

Judging from the outcry on the Turbotax user forum, many others were also affected by this incorrect depreciation calculation.  I suspect that thousands of taxpayers were impacted.  So why hasn't anyone filed a class action suit against TurboTax?  Well, if you read the software license, by using the software you give up your right to sue Intuit and must settle your grievance in binding arbitration.  Arbitrators almost always find in favor of the company so why even bother going there.  Furthermore, the fine print in the software license states that Turbotax does not guarantee that the software will produce the right answer so you use it at your own risk.  How convenient - for Intuit.

I have had it with this shoddy company.  I'm switching to the new guy on the block: TaxAct.  It is much cheaper and hopefully more accurate.  If it is not I will switch again - bit not to TurboTax.  Screw them!
