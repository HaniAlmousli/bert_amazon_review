Most of my reviews on Amazon are for entertainment related items but this software was sent to me by Amazon as part of their Vine Reviewer program in which they send items to a selected group of reviewers. I have been curious about doing some genealogy research on my family history and this was a good chance to try it. I figured that I could do it at my leisure.

There are two versions of Family Tree Maker. The basic one and this deluxe one. The Deluxe version includes a 3-month subscription to Ancestry.com.  For those into ongoing research, Ancestry.com is the go-to place and that is probably the reason that the trial subscription is included. But since you need to enter a credit card when setting up your Ancestry.com account, you need to remember to cancel your subscription before the expiration date or it renews automatically. This also means that the Clock starts when you first subscribe. So it is best to wait until you have time to work on this project before starting your subscription.
I found that I became busy with other more important things  after signing on and , honestly I haven't used the software a lot since I got it. Amazon requires Vine reviews within 30 days so Im posting this now and will edit as I get back on to the project. But I did want to point out that you will find yourself depending on Ancestry.com to keep your tree up to date and that is an ongoing subscription.

I hope you found at least some of this info helpful.
