I have been a Norton Internet customer for years. But I have given up on them. I purchased NIS 2008 to upgrade my 2007 version, which was working fine, but the subscription was over. I downloaded and installed the eval product while I waited for my CD order to arrive. After installing it I noticed that whenever I filled out a form, particularly an Outlook (OWA)email, and sent the message the parent browser window would close. Sometimes all the opened browsers would close. This was pretty fustrating, so I started a Chat session with Symantec Technical Support. I won't trouble you with all the details,but the guy told me I had a virus and it would cost me $99 for them to fix it. I explained to him that the 2007 version never found any virus and this only occurred after installing 2008. I uninstalled 2008 and reinstalled 2007 the problem went away. After the rude, totally unrelated questions and their demand for me to pay them to fix their problem, I have had enough. I have 6 days left on the NIS subscription then I am going to McAfee. Thanks for nothing Symantec.
