I think as Norton have tried to add more features, this thing has become too bloated and also too 'vocal' with popups coming up for everything, just like it needs to justify it's existence and expense somehow. I honestly think that the less resource-intensive and free offerings such as the Microsoft offering and even AVG, coupled with taking some care what attachments and links you click on are far better than spending money on this sort of thing.
