As with most PCs, the time it takes for my computer to boot up has increased dramatically since I bought it.  Of course, I have more stuff on my desktop and more things to load into memory when the PC boots up than on a new PC.  However, the software advertises that it "accelerates slow system startups."  If anything, my system starts more slowly after I used this software than before.  Waste of money.  Don't count on it speeding up your startups if that is all you are buying it for.
