I had version 7-- and wrote a pretty scathing review on Amazon, if you care to look. But I still had a need for voice recognition software to transcribe interviews for my job, and frankly, Dragon seems to be the main game in town. So I decided to give them one more shot. I wasn't expecting much.

I was blown away. On the same computer with the same sound card and other equipment, I went from about 60% accuracy to at least 90% accuracy out of the box. Far fewer glitches with this version, too... my old version began inserting random periods and refusing to capitalize the beginnings of sentences. This software makes my job tons easier and doesn't frustrate me at all. If you're hesitating because you haven't liked old versions, I suggest giving it a second shot. I'm very glad I did.

The headset-- it worked just fine, but it wasn't comfortable on my head. I've used two others since then (not expensive ones), all with good results.

Four stars because their tech support is a joke. No one should have to pay $9.95 to ask questions about their own (known) glitches. I haven't had to use tech support for this version, but it was infuriating on the old one. I paid-- and they still didn't resolve my problem.
