When I choose a software program to use I look for those that are so intuitive that I can do in and play around without reading the directions.  This isn't it.  It has a lot of capbabilities but honestly I did not have the patience to figure them all out- especially since other providers offer a more intuitive interface.  If you are really into this for professional use or you want profession effects then it might be worth you taking the time to read through all the directions for "ultimate" experience.
