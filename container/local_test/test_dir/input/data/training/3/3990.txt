I can't believe that there are so many negative reviews of a software that's not even used until January 2009 when it's not even Thanksgiving.  It's difficult for me to accept that all of the people who posted a have actually used the 2008 version of TurboTax and dislike it. I'm giving this 3 stars because I haven't used it yet, but all my prior years' usage would get 5 stars.  I'm checking out the printing fee directly with Turbotax instead of automatically believing a negative review and then posting another negative review before actually using the software.  I suspect that H&R Block is having their employees post negative reviews in order to get people to purchase their own tax software.  I'm not buying it.
