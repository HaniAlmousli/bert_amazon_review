Installation was annoying but once installed, the program functioned as expected. I had the key card. The instructions were clear. Log on to the office set up page, input the enclosed key code, sign in or create a Microsoft account and install. If only. I had to uninstall twice. Finally it continued downloading. It took a little over a hour which seemed excessive to load. But once if finally did, I was satisfied. The suite includes Word, Excel, PowerPointt and One Note. It does not contain Outlook, Publisher or Access. As such it is fine for school or home use but a tad spare for most businesses. This is not a subscription and it is limited to one computer. I'm not sure why the installation was so balky but overall, the program meets expectations.
