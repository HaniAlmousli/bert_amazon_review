I started an LLC last year, but didn't really know if I had done all that I needed to.  And I had a client tell me that I really needed to have a license/contract agreement.  I had been thinking about doing this, but didn't really know where to start, so when I saw this I thought it was the answer to my prayers.  Not only could I make sure my LLC was set up correctly, but I could use its forms and contracts to create what I was lacking.

I was disappointed in this product.  The forms were basic, and if you look online you'll find similar versions for free.  The contracts and some other documents link you to buy the actual forms.  They weren't available in this product.  I'm not quite sure what they think the price you pay is good for, but I expected this to have those things in this program.

In the end, I didn't find much value in this program and I would not recommend it to a friend.  I'm on the look out for a new program that will help me with the license/contract that I need to make.
