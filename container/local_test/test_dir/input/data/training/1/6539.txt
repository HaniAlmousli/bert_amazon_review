I have had three computers brick with Windows 8.  Two were brand new laptops and one was a one and a half year old desktop PC.  All three had the same issue.  When booting up for the first time everything seemed to go fairly well, once logged in things were a little laggy and unstable and required updates.  Once the updates were almost all installed it began doing the required restarts and thats where the problems bagan.  Some of the updates were broken causing an infinate restart loop until eventually (sometimes days later) it would say there was an error installing updates reverting to previous installation.....that was good except for it never did revert and only stayed on the "reverting to previous version" screen forever.  I returned the two laptops for a refund and had to buy a new PC even microsoft support said to return them and they were toast.  Garbage.
