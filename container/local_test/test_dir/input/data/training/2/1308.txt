UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------------
The Apple issued service packs have essentially eliminated all of the problems with Leopard.  While I am disappointed that there were so many bugs at the time of release, Apple seems to have the worst of it behind them.

I have been a big Mac fan (not to be confused with the hamburger) for nearly a year. All Apple products have run smooth and installation has been effortless.... and then along comes Leopard. I am very surprised at the number of positive reviews after my recent experiences... my highlights and low-lights after 4 days.

- Internet connectivity - I am "dropped" offline on regular occurrences. At first I thought it was our modem/router until I reset both of them only to still be offline. The only thing that worked... restarting my Mac. Maybe it is a coincidence but the this began happening the day I loaded Leopard.

- Memory HOG! I am not sure where it *went* but I now have an additional 20 gigs of hard-drive that is being occupied!

- Not so plug-and-play. I have a Logitech Harmony al-in-one remote ... it works with all previous versions of Mac o/s... but it will not recognize leopard during the set-up. I wonder how many other devices will have this problem?

- Random freezing. Seriously, this is why we dumped our PC! We were looking for a more stable operating system. I wouldn't compare it to the nightmare that is known as Vista... but Windows XP has an edge over Leopard.

- The added features are nice- Time Machine makes backing up a cinch..... but is it worth it? You also get a much clearer picture when you Ichat... too bad the internet connectivity problems reduce our ability to Ichat.

  As a whole....I would like to remove Leopard and wait until a service pack comes out to reinstall it. My recommendation - Hold-off.
