I have a pretty decent background with high end photo editing suites and CAD software and I have a pretty big tolerance for lag times.  However this Corel Draw package is so slow to load I rarely use it.  The feature set?  Great.  The price?  A good value for what you get.  The load time?  Two minutes + on a fairly modern Quad core system running Win7.  I just couldn't take it any more.

Now frankly if you are a pro, that initial setup is nothing.  Once you are in, this package delivers on the goods.  But since I'm using this at home, I don't need the hassle of the overhead for most tasks.  I would go for a scaled down Corel suite (save yourslef the money and time).
