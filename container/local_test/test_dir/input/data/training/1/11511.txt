The instructions in the box are inadequate. The trick is that after activating it on one device you have to log in to your account and download it from there to additional devices. You do not activate it for each device.

The activation screen has an option for if you have already activated the device. If you notice it, you can try that route. However, it asked for my email and phone number and found no account, apparently their bug because when I went to norton.com I could log in from there. Once in my account I found that I could download to the device from which I logged in. I have had other problems with Norton in the past. One  year I returned it. My take is that they did a poor job of testing there user interfaces and provided inadequate documentation for the current release.
