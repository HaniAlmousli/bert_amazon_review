I prepared returns for C corp, S corp and LLC. The S corp could not be e-filed because of bugs in the program but no trouble with the C and LLC.

If one accepts that e-file won't work (or else won't work well) for S corp, then the disappointment won't be as great. Here's a list of most of the bugginess I experienced with the S:
* Would not provide a form that I needed, one of the basic forms.
* Gave me an error for my zip code, saying it's not in my state, although it is.
* One of the forms was mislabeled, a weird thing to happen and a software problem.

But I e-filed the C and LLC, and I paper filed the S. So one can make the program work.

Also, I was able to upload my last year's tax filings which I had saved on my hard drive and were from the same H&R Block tax software. There was no trouble whatsoever with that, and I was actually most worried about that.

All in all, I would buy this tax software again and probably will next year. I dislike that I can't use it on another operating system other than Windows, but then again it's not highly priced when one has several returns to prepare.

It's not the easiest tax software to use, giving warnings that are sometimes unhelpful and cannot be "fixed." But it's not that difficult either except of course that I could not e-file the S due to some software bugs. I would not recommend it to a true friend nor would I try to dissuade anybody from using it at their own risk as we do whenever we use inexpensive tax software that's targeted to nonprofessionals.
