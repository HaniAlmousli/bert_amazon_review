I had some problems with this product at first because I was using another product that didn't seem to allow this system to operate properly.  I was getting some very strange conflicts.  I removed the other item to see what this would do and it worked very nice.  I set it to do several system scans and it located spyware that had evidently been active on my system for some time.  I uninstalled PC Tools Internet Security 2009 V6 and reinstalled my former sypware product.  After about two weeks I reversed the process and reinstalled PC Tools Internet Security.... again, several spyware operations were found on my PC.  I think this application is a good investment and does an excellent job at a reasonable price.
