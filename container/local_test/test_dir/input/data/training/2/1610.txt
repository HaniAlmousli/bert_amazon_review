I used to use NAV on all my computers. The last few years though, it has gone done hill more each year. NAV 2008 is no exception. It is more bloated and than ever. Symantec needs to start over from scratch, and put out a real new version. A version that has less bugs, doesn't slow systems down to a crawl, and doesn't require 100's of MB's of disk space. The only reason I don't give it one star is that the program does do a decent job of stopping viruses.
