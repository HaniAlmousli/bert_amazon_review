I've been a strong Microsoft supporter for decades. When Windows 7 was out, I bought more than six copies to upgrade every single computer I had access to.

Fast forward to November 2012, I ran out of Windows 7 boxes so I had to buy a new one. Windows 8 was already out so why not getting the "latest and greatest"? BIG mistake.

I'm trying to like it, but I can't, I just can't.

If a veteran Windows user has to open google and search for "How to access control panel in Windows 8" then you're doing something SERIOUSLY wrong.

I'm sorry, but GUIs are supposed to be intuitive! Another example: how are you supposed to guess the "hot corners" without doing some research or somebody telling you?

Trust me, as soon as you start using Windows 8 you'll find yourself in situations where you want to go back and there's no back button, you'll want to close something and there'll be no "close" button, you'll want to configure an application and there'll be no menu or "settings" button.

Yeah I get it! it's the whole Metro/Tablet thing, right? I'm sorry but my main computer at work is not a tablet, it's a workstation and I deserve a real OS, not something that resembles my phone or some kind of kindergarten software.

Anyway, I've been flirting with the idea of getting a MacBook Pro for a long time, well, Windows 8 gave the little push I was missing. I just bought one and I'm in love with i (I can run my Windows software using Parallels).

Way to go Microsoft! you just lost one loyal customer.
