I have used taxcut for at least 10 years with no issue.  Granted, my return is not that complicated, w-2, several 1099's, mortgage interest, real estate taxes, and a K-1.  The federal and state went smoothly and e-filed both.

The only complaint, which is why it gets 4 stars rather than 5, is that past versions allowed you to compare the current year with the national average.  This is not longer a feature (at least not during the interview process).
