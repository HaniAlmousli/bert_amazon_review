Pros: Works well.

Cons: Purchased Parallels 9 and received an activation code in May 2014. Installed program successfully.
  Mac crashed September 5, 2014 and I lost the program.
  Sept 5 I tried to download Parallels 9 from their website but there was no link to 9. The download only permitted Parallels
  10, at a hefty upgrade price.
  Support/contact/mail numbers were not functional on their website....I was going to ask for a link to the 9 download.

Net: I had the program for 4 months and was forced to pay an upgrade fee to get 10, if I wanted to use Parallels. My original price of $79.95 was revealed by Parallels to be only a 4 month license. I feel cheated, had, taken to the cleaners.
