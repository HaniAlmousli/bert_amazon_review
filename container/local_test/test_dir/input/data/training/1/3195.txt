This is possibly the worst operating system I've ever used. Every single time you open an application, download something, or do anything at all, the system asks you for your "permission" to proceed. What a stupid waste of time.

The system is also incredibly unreliable, almost demonically so. I had installed Vista on my MAC in order to take the New York Bar Exam on my computer. However, the day of the exam, when I opened Microsoft Vista, it locked me out of the operating system and asked me for my product registration key - even though I had entered it when I installed Vista earlier. I had no warning that the operating system was just going to lock me out randomly - I had even tested it the night before.

If you use your computer for anything important, I would highly recommend against using this piece of garbage.
