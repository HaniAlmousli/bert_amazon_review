I've been using TurboTax for two decades.  Just purchased and downloaded 2010 Premier.  It will not install.  Generates an Error Code: 1326.  Went to Intuit support.  They are aware of the issue but have no solution.

No Amazon buyer protection or refund.  The software download site is Amazon by name only.  Kind of like the Android Market.  Problem?  Not our problem.  Zero support.

I'm running Win 7.
