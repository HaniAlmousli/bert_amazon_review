Get your geeky friend if you're a novice (like me).  Only my friends ended up being a limited amount of YouTube videos because I would have been unable to do some basic things otherwise.  Installation didn't take forever and the manual is like spanish if you don't know anything about photo editing software.  I made the mistake of thinking that my knowledge of Photoshop wold suffice but it doesn't.  However, if you have some level of understanding, I'm sure it's a great program.
