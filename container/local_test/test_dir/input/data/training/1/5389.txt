Was unable to download "Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 to my WinVista laptop, subsequently acquired the "Ultimate" version and truly did wish to have the opportunity to test it, however, no matter how I tried it would not install to my HP Win Vista Laptop; each time an error 1935 window popped up with a suggestion to call help & support for more information. I subsequently made the point to read the EULA and, sure enough, there's an indication the program will not work w/Win Vista. So be it. And I am not happy, as others have noted regarding information obtained by "Corel" through use of the program.
