I have used PowerDVD before, a lower version but have used it before. This one encompasses everything you need for a media player - be able to Blu-Ray and all types of file extensions, including disc images that are burned to the computer. It can even play things that I have had to get VLC player to play. It is also able to sync to a smartphone and grab images from there and share it on computer or view videos nd images on your phone, basically acting as a media server.

The installation was a very easy process. It didn't install any extra software that you don't need, which is so important to me. Once installed, it was able to automatically detect file extensions that this can play. Music, movies, and pictures... it does it all.

Now performance wise, the pictures on the computer and videos load pretty quickly and I was able to start a burned image very quickly as well. The only big issues with performance had to do with when it is being used as a media server or when it is pulling from the phone. It took a long time to load images onto the computer from the phone when it is turned on. Also, when I try to get some of the videos and pictures from my phone after downloading the app, it took a while to load as well.

Other than that, I have had no issues with the software and do like all the features it has to offer. I think the biggest gripe would be with the price. While all the features are great, it is just a bit steep and may deter someone from buying this when there are other free players out there.
