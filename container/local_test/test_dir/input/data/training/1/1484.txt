I just got a nasty virus on my XP powered computer.  This forced me to delete my hard drive and rebuild my computer.  My wife works for a university, so she was able to get Vista for $25.  I figured I would do a fresh install with a full version Vista ultimate.  At first, my computer ran fine, but day by day it kept getting slower and slower.  I have a fast computer, but at any given time, Vista is using 70% of my 1 gig of memory.  I can run about 2 or 3 programs, but after that, things start crashing.  Sure I could upgrade, but why would I want to spend money to upgrade my hardware to do the same stupid tasks I was doing just fine with XP?  Vista also uses 15 extra gigabytes of hard drive space.  15 Gigabytes can hold about 1000 mp3 files or 50,000 pictures.  The pop ups are annoying too.  This means I get to spend $400 and subtract my hard drive space, upgrade my memory, and deal with annoying pop ups that ask me if I know what I'm doing; for a pretty version of XP, right? How did this company manage to dominate the OS market?

I installed a copy of Ubuntu.  It took 10 minutes to install.  All of my pictures, videos, music, MS Word and Excel files transferred over flawlessly.  With Vista, I could multitask with about 4 programs without crashing.  With Ubuntu, I can have 30 programs running and it still doesn't slow down...with 1 gig of memory! Did I mention that 99% of viruses are coded for Windows?  I can actually get better internet security by virtue of flying under the radar.
