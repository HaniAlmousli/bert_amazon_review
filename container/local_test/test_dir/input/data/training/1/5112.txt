TurboTax Business 2010 has still not fixed bugs that have existed for several years.  In fact, I cannot tell that there is a single improvement over prior editions.  I think Intuit is milking this product for profit rather than investing in it.

For example, for corporations, the Form 1120 defaults to assuming that someone owns 20% or more of the firm, forcing the listing of such people on a form G.  As in years past, you must switch to forms mode, uncheck the box (never offered in the interview) that says someone owns more than 20% of the firm, and then manually delete the G.

The most infuriating thing about the 1120 is that as of yesterday, March 13, you could neither print nor e-file the return - which is due on March 15 (!) - because the TurboTax forms were out of date.  Yet, the iRS released the final 1120 forms on March 1.  How could it possibly take a vastly capitalized corporation like Intuit more than a day to make whatever minor adjustments were in the final forms?  TurboTax did update itself today, March 14, to allow for filing.  Infuriatingly last-minute nonsense.

When e-filing the 1120 today, now that the forms are available, I chose ACH debit (as opposed to EFTPS) to pay the tax due.  On the confirmation screen, TurboTax confirmed that I selected EFTPS (not) with an edit button to change it - clicking the Edit button took me back to the screen showing ACH and the bank routing/account numbers/etc.  Just one of a dozen or more glitchy buggy things.

A cosmetic bug, but one that is disconcerting, is a screen under Federal Review that just says "This is Heading Text / This is a Subheading"  (screenshot posted with product images above).  Clicking the Federal Review tab again gets the correct page, but, really.

For trusts filing 1041, expenses allocated to income are still not allocated, by default, to interest and dividends (etc) by pro-ration, as is done by most tax preparers, not is there a question or checkbox in the interview to allow for that.  As in years past, all expenses are subtracted against interest, fully, first, then dividends/other income.  You have to switch to forms mode and find the checkbox to manually check to do the allocation as desired.  K-1 allocations are also not complete, with Foreign Tax credit not properly allocated to the beneficiary.

These are just a few of the issues in this clunky, never-improved, Intuit cash-cow.  For folks who are not tax nerds, you should have any return that is prepared by this software reviewed by a tax professional.  Foolish me, I keep buying this each year thinking that it will improve.
