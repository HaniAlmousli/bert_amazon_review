For software where you can pick up free versions, like 7-zip, I'm surprised Corel has this retailing for $60. Even winrar comes with a trial that never expires, but it will nag you every time you run it. On top of this, you can purchase it online for half the cost of this.

Otherwise, it installed easily enough and it is now my default unzip software. I was happy with it until this morning....

When I logged onto my computer, it said an update was available. No problem, I said to go ahead and download/install the update. After the install, it took me through the installation wizard. I was a little nervous because this is when extra software likes to piggy back onto your computer.

Sure enough, after the install some colorful, round icon appeared on my desktop. I was upset because 1) this is paid software for crying out loud. Fine, try to sneak stuff in when it is free, I get that you need to pay the bills. But this wasn't free, this was $60!! And then even worse is 2) it never prompted me to install this software. Usually when I update Java I catch that it is trying to install a toolbar and I tell it not to. With this, it didn't even give me the option, it just installed it hoping I wouldn't notice.

I immediately uninstalled the new software, but when I got to work I noticed my Chrome (which syncs settings with my home computer) now had a new home page. Needless to say, I'm not happy.

Honestly, I didn't realize until now that WinZip is owned by Corel. Upon the realization I muttered, "That explains things." I've had nothing but bad luck with Corel ever since they bought Word Perfect. I would have skipped this completely if I had noticed who sells it now. The fact they obscure their name from the product is rather telling.
