I am a casual photographer but one who enjoys refining and playing with my images. I'm a Mac user and take most of my shots with an iPhone 6+.  So what does AfterShot offer the casual photographer compared to other products?

Compared to the Mac native Photos app: it has more precise and extensive image editing and the ability to edit RAW images, but the interface is clunky and confusing compared to other programs. It does have the Perfectly Clear image refinement engine built in which is nice. It has much better image cataloging and metadata but does not have facial recognition, which doesn't matter to a professional but is important to casual users.

Compared to Lightroom: it's cheaper than Lightroom, but Lightroom's interface is more polished and has the advantage of integration with Photoshop and the entire Abode Creative Cloud. Easy to exchange images between camera, phone, and multiple computers is a big plus. Instructional help with Adobe is superior than Corel.

Compared to Affinity: This Mac native App won an Apple Design Award. It's cheaper than both Lightroom and Aftershot, with a better interface and more power than Photos.

Summary: AfterShot is a perfectly capable program, but depending on your needs is probably not the best choice for any Mac user.
