This is not a program for a beginner, if you have not used something similar before you will find yourself lost.
There is a steep learning curve, and without help from my children the only thing I could with this program
was make my pictures look worse, I couldn't even manage to use the cropping tool properly.
I strongly suggest using all resources available to you, there are how-to videos available on the Corel
website, and ask friends and family for help.
Unfortunately I need to learn how to do this, so I will keep plugging away at it and not saving any of my work
until I manage to make something besides a mess
