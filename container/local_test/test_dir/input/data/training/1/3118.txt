I have been an avid Norton Symantec user for over 13 years.  This is the worst product EVER. It slows your system down so much that I had to disable most of the features, which an average user will not know how to do.

My biggest complaint is that once the "virus update" expires.. it renders the entire software useless. I couldn't even go in and make simple changes to the settings, nothing to do with the virus update feature. PLUS  A pop-up comes up everyday twice a day begging me to buy another year subscription. That is false. What they are really asking is that I buy the software again. Once a year is up .. you might as well throw it in the trash OR give it to someone else OR wipe your hard drive and install a fresh copy.

I am not happy with it at all! I will never buy any anti-virus or internet security software from this company again.  I have heard of complaints that it will crash your system the day it expires.

Uninstalling any Norton products are difficult and you should find a good article on the internet on how to do this.  NOTE: You must uninstall any anti-virus software if you are installing a different brand.
