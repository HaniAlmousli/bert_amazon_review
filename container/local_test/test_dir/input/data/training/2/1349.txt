I have been a Quicken user for 13 years.  I upgraded to 2007 and it lost some of my data during the conversion.  After several hours with support (live chat) they never found a solution.

Then they say to call them and Intuit wants to charge me twenty four dollars to get assistance for their bug.  Sorry Intuit, you have gotten too big and have forgotten the customers who made you.  Over the last few years your customer service has gotten worse.  You just don't care anymore.  I think it may be time for me to move on to other vendors.

If you are happy with your current, reliable, Quicken version stick with it.  I was on 2002 and am going back to it.  However, I think I will try out some of Quickens competitors.  Never thought I would say that as a huge Quicken fan.
