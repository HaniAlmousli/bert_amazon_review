This has a few bells and whistles, but is not worth the hassle or the headache. It isn't "compatible" with existing Norton accounts, so if you have time remaining on a subscription from a different version of Norton, you would lose those days by installing this version.

We already had renewable Norton contracts on our smart phones, so we did not attempt to install it on those, but I lost almost 4 months of coverage that I still had remaining from the Norton 360 that was previously installed on my computer. I guess I could fight with telephone support at Symantec and try to get that put back on my account, but personally, I have things going on that are more urgent than spending a couple of hours on the phone with tech/product support.

My advice is to skip this, and get the Norton 360 Multi-Device instead,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Norton-360-Multi-Device-2014-1-User-5-Devices/dp/B00EZPXVWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Norton 360 Multi-Device 2014 - 1 User / 5 Devices</a>&nbsp;it is less expensive, it has already proven itself to work well with all my devices and it won't invalidate the remaining time that you have on your current Norton antivirus coverage.
