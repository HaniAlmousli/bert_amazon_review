Roxio used to be a well-known brand name in the editing software business.  Sadly the name lives on but the quality of the product does not.  I had the product as a disc.  My first attempt to install on Windows 10 failed.  Second attempt worked.  No instructions or help are provided in the box and the website provided no help either.  So essentially you are on your own for the install.  Once installed I had a problem with the program freezing.

I would then have to force close the program and reopen.  Quite a hassles, while it isn't that hard ot figure out how to use the software, again I could not find any documentation as to how to use the different features.  I tried some editing projects and some burning to disc, but I kept having freezing problems.  I did send an email to Roxio tech support and never received an answer.  I should note I have no other programs who freeze like this.  Sadly I think I will uninstall the program, until I can find out what the problem with my software is.
