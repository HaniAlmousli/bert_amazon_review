McAfee Anti-Theft 2009 1 User needs Activation, to get the updates, and I would assume to register. It would be more ideal if written into the code of this activation was the Name of the person so that theft of any key files could be traced. This uses vaults to safeguard personal files , and for each password protected vault there is a set of three pre-defined questions if you forget your password ( no room is given for a user defined field).
There are ten questions in these fields, and all seem to be standard social engineering style questions, and therefore accessible by someone skilled in that area; a definite risk factor.
After the the solution questions, you then create the Vault Name, Size, and password. An advanced button allows for some more detailed manipulation.
 The anti-theft step 3 gives instructions on how to secure one and only copies of files ( a risky prospect, but one useful for security ). When needed the vault can be transferred.
Apart from the lack of any useful instruction on Password quality ( you would think a password generator might be included or even suggested) there is little to help secure the vaults. Whilst a person familiar with standard and non -standard security will get a good run on this software, the average user should steer clear of this item since it is eminently hackable, and if you are seriously after a way to secure files, and/or Drive contents, there are better, and far more secure options.
