So it is months later and do I like it now? No. I absolutely despise it and the horse it rode in on. I can say that I am more or less used to 8.1 but getting there was a huge productivity killer, so many internet queries, "Where did they put create a system image?", etc. Worse, Microsoft keeps on nagging me to upgrade to Win 10. I spent half a morning learning how to kill their pestering. Do I have anything good to say about Win 8.1? No, nope, nyet, nada, zip.  Getting rid of all the crapware and Microsoft store clutter took too long. There should be a "decrappify my new PC" switch. Apple OS's aren't any better so your best bet is a Linux distro and Libraoffice. I use Knoppix, but for my next machine I might start with UBUTU.

BTW out of the blue office stopped working on my win 7 pc a few days ago. Reinstalling did not help. What happened? It looks like some sort of maintenance failed and corrupted it. Win 10 stuff?

 What I wrote when I was first using Win 8.1:
Tried it, hate it, a bucket of tar. You can't swim, you can't tread water, you only sink. I've been using Microsoft releases (and numerous other operating systems since DOS. Most were small increments of frustration, new bugs and a few new goofy features, but not Win 8. It is just plain ugly. So what is wrong with those executives at MS? Why do they feel compelled to make us learn a new way to do the same thing every three years? I have two machines, a slow old Win 7 machine and a screaming fast new Win 8 PC. The fast machine has an SSD, tons of memory, fast i7 processor and so on. Boots in a flash and then I try to do anything, and Win 8's new "features" stop me dead in my tracks. I spend the day querying the internet reading solutions from other unhappy Win 8 users. (BTW, I am a computer professional who has used numerous other operating systems. I give this one the prize for being the most annoying.) Does anyone like Win 8 you ask? The Win 8 project manager who should be sent to Siberia? I have a job to do and buying a fast PC slows me down because of Win 8. Often I boot the old Win 7 machine just so I can get my work done. Bottom line, do not buy Win 8 and pray that Win 10 is better or for a sure bet, find a copy of Win 7. Wish I had a spare, I'd blow away Win 8 faster than you can say SSD.
