I originally posted a review of this product which disappeared into the Amazon ether.  Just as well, because it was a more or less positive review and now, even though I have fibromyalgia and typing hurts, I'd rather be in pain than use Dragon Naturally Speaking.  First of all, while it will run on all but the oldest computers, it slows everything way down.  Try running it while you've got anti-virus software running and the lag time after you dictate is really annoying, especially when you realize it's garbled what you said quite badly, or made strange choices among homophones.  It has a particularly bad time with a standard American accent. It does much better if you speak with an exaggerated New York accent (think Mike Meyers doing "Coffee Talk" on SNL).  Otherwise, if you pronounce "dawn" and "Don" the same, it will choose Don everytime, even if the context doesn't make sense.  It's probably great for dictating things like book reports using simple, common words and not too many names or capitalized terms, but if you are dictating something complex or with a lot of specialized terms or abbreviations, or defined terms that are capitalized, it leaves a lot to be desired.  And you've got to get it right the first time, because moving around within a document to edit is downright irritating, especially if you want to correct a word that appears multiple times.  It's supposed to get better the longer you use the program and the more it gets "trained," but honestly it just gets worse.  The program also has an annoying habit of thinking ordinary dictation is a command word and opening up a pull-down menu when you least expect or want it to.

If you really can't type, it's better than nothing, but unless you also use a headset for voice over internet applications, you'll probably want to get a desktop microphone for use with this -- the headset that comes with the software isn't comfortable for extended periods of time and the standard software doesn't work with BlueTooth headsets.  I haven't used this program in a really long time.  It's just too frustrating, so unless I am writing something really long, I'd rather hurt a little.  It would be great for a more phonetic language, but for English it leaves a lot to be desired.
