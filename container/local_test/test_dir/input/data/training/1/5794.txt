We've been running Trend Micro for the last 10+ years, and thought it was pretty good. Then we started having serious problems with our computers, specifically slowing down, failing to recognize hyperlinks, failing to transmit passwords properly (e.g., the New York Times), interference with websites (e.g., amazon failing to operate properly) and the security software itself turning off spontaneously. Yet this software failed to recognize the problem.

So, I loaded the free security software that comes with Windows 7 (Microsoft Security Essentials), and in short order it identified two notorious pieces of malware (VCQ.exe and DropInSavings) plus seven lesser ones. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to reach the conclusion to replace Trend Micro with Microsoft Security Essentials or some other security software that actually works.
