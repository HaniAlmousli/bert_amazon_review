I have used Norton since windows 95. About eight years ago I also started using System Mechanic for my utilities software. Last year Norton started popping up saying there was a compatibility issue with System Mechanic and wanted to delete it. After some consideration I decided to solve the issue and switched to Webroot Internet Security. Norton is a very good product but not compatible with some software. I prefer System Mechanic for maintenance over Norton.
